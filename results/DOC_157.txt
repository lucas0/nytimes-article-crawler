AdvertisementSupported byRefugees from around the world worked at the Smithfield pork factory in Sioux Falls. Now they face mounting illness and the sudden loss of their jobs.By Caitlin Dickerson and Miriam JordanAn immigrant from El Salvador bought a three-bedroom home with a basement for her family. A single mother from Ethiopia sent her daughters to college. A refugee from Sudan bought bunk beds for her boys, new couches and a dining table.Before the Smithfield pork factory in Sioux Falls became the radiating core of South Dakota’s coronavirus outbreak, with more than 640 cases linked to the plant, it had been a kind of beacon of American prosperity for tens of thousands of employees who landed on the high prairie from Africa, East Asia and Latin America. But the opportunities were not obtained easily.For more than 100 years, people fleeing war zones and abject poverty have put in long hours at the eight-story plant that churns 24 hours a day alongside the tree-lined Big Sioux River. They worked side by side in front of speeding conveyor belts and behind vibrating electric knives powerful enough to slice through a hog every 30 to 40 seconds. Many iced their wrists at night and relied on a daily dose of ibuprofen to keep up with the work of slaughtering, processing and packaging pork products for global consumption.In return, they received wages above the minimum and health benefits that stretched far in a state with a low cost of living, uplifting generations of immigrants who arrived in the United States without formal education or knowledge of the English language.That all appeared to be in jeopardy this week, when the Smithfield plant became the nation’s largest single-source coronavirus hot spot. Its employees now make up about 44 percent of the diagnoses in South Dakota, and a team of researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has traveled there to assess how the outbreak spiraled out of control. Smithfield is the latest meat processing facility to close in the face of the coronavirus.The startling toll on the workers has drawn criticism from union leaders who say the facility’s owners waited too long to introduce safety measures, and instead encouraged employees to meet the demand for their products that has surged amid the pandemic.But workers, many at home battling weekslong fevers and debilitating body aches, are now facing another cruel reality of the virus: They are mourning both their co-workers and the jobs that made them sick.With looming bills and the expectations of family members in the United States and abroad whom they support with their pay from Smithfield, many say they are eager to return to their jobs, including the double shifts they routinely put in over six and even seven days a week. During the closure, they have been guaranteed 80 hours of paid leave, far less than most would have earned through routine overtime. What more might be available through bonus funds is unclear.For many of the workers, risk is nothing new. They fled war, food insecurity or ethnic persecution to reach the United States. Though they have seen colleagues crushed by fast-moving machinery, toppled by greasy floors and burned by powerful cleaning agents, many say they consider the job a privilege.“I can’t wait to go back to work for the simple reason that this is the only thing that supports my family,” said Achut Deng, a Sudanese refugee who in six years worked her way up from a “wizard knife” operator paid $12.75 an hour to a shift lead making $18.70. “I do feel sorry for everyone who is going through this, I feel sorry for myself, but it’s like, I feel better now so I’d rather go back to work.”The devastation wrought by the virus on their workplace and families has been swift. Smithfield employees and their family members account for nearly 70 percent of coronavirus diagnoses in Minnehaha County, which includes Sioux Falls.One worker, Agustin Rodriguez, 64, died this week after contracting the virus. Mr. Rodriguez, an immigrant from El Salvador who cut pork feet at the factory, was active in his church; he lived in a trailer but was in the process of buying a home.“He was a very friendly, respectful person,” said José Lopez, a former Smithfield worker who had been a break room buddy of Mr. Rodriguez, adding: “I have many friends who tested positive. This virus really hit us badly.”Yet many workers said that the grueling work at the plant, before the virus hit, had offered them a life that otherwise would never have been possible as immigrants and refugees.“Honestly, I was able to improve myself,” said Yoli Hernandez, a single mother of four from El Salvador, who started at the plant in 1999 and earns $17.30 an hour. “This is the only place where I was able to make a living and raise my kids.”Sara Birhe, whose family arrived in Sioux Falls from Ethiopia in 2001, said her mother bought a four-bedroom house and sent her children to college on a single income from the plant. “Working at Smithfield, you can provide for your family and not struggle as much as if you were working in California, Chicago or D.C.,” she said.Kooper Caraway, president of the Sioux Falls chapter of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the leaders began sounding alarm bells more than a month ago that the plant, because of its crowded conditions and lack of protective gear, could become a coronavirus hot spot.“Management just kind of dragged their feet, kicked the can down the road,” Mr. Caraway said. “They just decided it was more profitable to hold off on instituting any of these changes until they absolutely had to. But by then, the virus was out of control.”Smithfield officials said they have enhanced cleaning and disinfection at the plant, provided additional protective gear and expanded employee health benefits. They said they have also installed plexiglass and other physical barriers as well as thermal scanning equipment to detect employees with fevers.“We are laser-focused on our employees’ health and well-being and are immediately taking all necessary actions to protect them,” Kenneth M. Sullivan, the company’s president and chief executive, said in a statement.Ms. Deng, the refugee from Sudan, said she and her colleagues initially figured the virus could not be worse than what they had already lived through, “the war, the fighting, not enough to eat.”After hours on the factory floor, they had gathered around communal tables in the crowded and boisterous lunchrooms, sharing sambusa from Sudan, egg rolls from China, tibs and injera from Ethiopia. They told stories that reflect different paths to the United States, yet struggles that were much the same.Updated May 28, 2020States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people.Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)More than 40 million people — the equivalent of 1 in 4 U.S. workers — have filed for unemployment benefits since the pandemic took hold. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.At 6 years of age, after her grandmother was killed in an attack on her village in Sudan, Ms. Deng walked to a refugee camp in Ethiopia. She was later resettled in Kenya and, eventually, in the United States. She has gone days without food and put on shoes for the first time when she was 14.But her bravado began to fade this month, when her fever rose to 103 degrees and she felt like something heavy was crushing her chest, preventing her from breathing. While her three young sons slept, she perched on the living room couch in her apartment, paid for by working 11-hour days at Smithfield, six times a week for nearly seven years. She was determined not to fall asleep because she feared she would not wake up.“I thought, ‘OK, this is just like any other nightmare that I’ve been through,’” she said. “If I die, my kids are literally going to grow up just like I did. And it’s something I cannot put my head around.”On top of providing for her own children, she also pays for an apartment in Uganda for her parents and for student housing for two of her brothers.The company has said that workers must be asymptomatic for three days without taking medication and receive a doctor’s note before they can return to the processing lines. So she has been weaning herself off Tylenol, trying to keep her fever down with tea and lemon.“This company does a lot of things when it comes to families, supporting families,” Ms. Deng said. “Most of them, they don’t know how to speak English, they don’t know how to read, where can they go after that? Where can they go and provide for the needs of their families?”William Daldoum said his wife, Patricia, 53, who came to the United States from Sudan, has helped put three of their five children through college with the job she has held at Smithfield for almost 20 years.“Refugees always have that mentality that you come to this country and you are thankful to be away from the war zone,” said Mr. Daldoum, a pastor at New Jerusalem International Church in Sioux Falls.Yet he said he had always wished his family could have found another way.“She is in pain all the time — neck, back and hands. She is tired all the time,” he said. “She just feels like she is obligated to do what she can do to support her family.”transcriptI came to America thinking I can never go through hell. But what if this come to me?This virus is very dangerous. It caught everybody off guard, including myself. I was never prepared for it.From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: One of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus in the U.S. has been inside a meat processing plant in South Dakota. My colleague, Caitlin Dickerson, speaks with one of its workers.It’s Monday, May 4th.As an immigration reporter, as soon as I hear that Covid-19 is starting to spread across the country, I start thinking about who are the most vulnerable people in this pandemic. And right away, meat and poultry plants come to mind. Because these facilities tend to be staffed by immigrants. There’s going to be a lot of pressure on workers to show up for work, because they’ve been deemed essential by the federal government. And because of the nature of the work — the facilities are massive, and often you have thousands of people working at a single time, and they literally stand shoulder to shoulder. They’re touching all the time.Hello?Are you there? Oh, shoot. You just dropped out. Something happened.So I’m put in touch with a woman named Achut Deng.Woo! We did it.Yes, we did. [LAUGHS]Just to start out, Achut, can you just kind of introduce yourself and tell us what work you do?So my name is Achut Deng. I work with Smithfield. We produce pork.Achut is a shift lead at the Smithfield pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.And I am a lead person for one department, 8th floor conversion.She works in the conversion department, deboning and processing all different cuts of pork. She’s 35. And she’s a single mom of three boys —Give — give me a second, OK? My son just come in. Give me a second.— who are trying to get their homework done while we talk.Sorry. I’m back.You’re back. You’re back. OK. So how did you come to work at Smithfield?Do you want me to go from South Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya and to America?Yeah.OK. So yes, I was born in South Sudan. But then, when I was six years old, we had a terrorist attack in the village.Achut was born in Sudan. And she became an orphan when she was six years old during the country’s civil war.And we walked to Kenya. And that was in 1990 — in 1991 still.She grew up in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, where life was really hard.They created the school. But pretty much, people go and sit under the tree. Because there was no building or classroom or anything like that in the beginning.Her school was a shady spot beneath a large tree, where children wrote their English lessons with sticks in the dirt.Yeah. It seemed like it was normal at the time, because we didn’t have no — any other choice.She often went days without having food or fresh water. A lot of her friends died. She didn’t know if she was ever going to leave. So she took life one day at a time.I would say it was just surviving. Because you don’t know what would happen tomorrow, you know?And then in the year 2000, her life changed completely.I got the news that I was going to get a second chance on life. I’m going to go to the United States.She was chosen for a program that relocated Sudanese orphans.Oh, my God. It was the happiest feeling for me. I could not believe. I didn’t go to sleep. The next day I went to school. I told my friends. Yeah.She moved to Kansas City, started a life in America.She graduated high school and started community college. And then she starts working as a waitress. And then, in her late 20s, doing private security.And then, how do you get to Sioux Falls, South Dakota?How? You know, I always tell people I moved to Sioux Falls for a very stupid reason, thinking that I find a man. So that was pretty much a reason — a reason right there. [LAUGHING] I moved — I moved in with my younger son’s father. Then we broke up.OK. And how did you hear about the Smithfield factory for the first time?He actually told me about it. Because before I moved here, I told him I cannot go a month without a job because a lot of people are relying on me, and most importantly, my kids. So and that’s when he told me, oh, yeah. There is a company here, Smithfield.And when you were hearing about it, what were people saying?There was good things. Your start wages with Smithfield was $12.95. That is a very good pay. They have health care, health insurance. So a lot of people came to Sioux Falls because of Smithfield and what it was offering to people. I know a lot of Sudanese families came here because of Smithfield. So when I went and put in my application, right in there they told me, OK, you’ll start tomorrow.Wow.And I started as a Whizard knife operator.And for someone who’s never heard of Smithfield or been to the plant, can you just walk through what exactly it is that you guys do there?So Smithfield — we receive live hogs, slaughter them, cut them into pieces. What I mean by that, by cutting off hams, legs, we make bacon, ham, even hotdogs, cheese hotdogs. We have them. Those are the things we do at Smithfield. So it’s the entire pig that come alive, turn into so many things afterwards.And what is a Whizard knife?It’s a circle knife that goes into this electric thing. And you turn it off and on.And what is it used for?They use Whizard knife to trim off fat, from the loin until there’s pretty much all meat. Just meat without fat.So picture a massive factory floor with giant chunks of pork zooming by on a conveyor belt. And Achut and the other Whizard knife operators are responsible for shaving fat off of the meat as it zooms past them.How many pigs are processed there every day?10,000 or more pig.That’s huge.Yeah.And they’re responsible for 4 to 5 percent of all the pork that’s produced in the United States.So when you first started, what did you think of it? How did it go?What did I think of Smithfield? Hard work. Hard work is what I thought of it. But you’re not really thinking of how hard it is. You are thinking of money. You know? And everything that — once you get the paycheck you are able to pay for the apartment. You are able to put foods on the table. These were the thing that I was thinking, you know?What was it like for you physically in the beginning, starting out?Once you start doing something for the first time, something that you never done, your muscle is going to reject it. Your body is going to reject it. So I was always sore. I was always — my wrists was sore. My arm, you know, went numb. So after work, I would come home and put ice, like, on my shoulder, or my wrist, and then take ibuprofen. And I did that every night.Wow.Until one day, I went to first aid. And I talked to the nurse. And the nurse was very, very nice, outgoing. And she said, you know what, Achut? Let me give you this advice. You know, this job is a hard work. It’s a very hard work. You’ve been doing this Whizard knife for a year now. And your wrist is hurting, your arm hurt, your shoulder hurt. I would do one job for about a year, but after that, find another job. That way you have a rotation in your body.So she takes this advice. And over the next couple years, she starts moving around in the factory to different jobs. She eventually becomes a shift lead. And she starts working a lot of overtime — usually 11 to 12 hours a day, six days a week. But it really pays off. She starts to feel comfortable financially.I get paid $18.70 an hour.What has that higher hourly wage meant for your life?My boys, all three of them — I can give them what I never have, which is a better life at a young age.Uh huh.Last year, I took them to Disney World. That’s just something that — when I went there, I cried. But it was a tears of happiness. I’m bringing my kids. I am American by papers. I bring my kids here. And that was something I did. I was so proud of myself.Between the new salary she’s making and the overtime that she’s working, she’s able to move into a bigger apartment with her sons. And she’s also supporting five family members who are still living in Africa.So this job offer me to take care for everybody else, not just my boys, you know?So you’re basically supporting nine people on your salary from Smithfield?Yes.Wow.So that’s why I pick up overtime regardless of me being tired. Every morning when I go to work, I put everything that the company offered me in order to make sure this food that I’m making doesn’t have anything that can go and harm someone. Because you know, these food are going to families. It’s going to children. It’s going to mothers. It’s going to fathers, uncles, aunts, everyone around the world. Working at the meat factory, I’m making food for people around the world. I think of that every day.It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job.Yes. I do.Do you remember the first time you heard about the coronavirus?Yeah. I would say it was sometime in January, February. We just talking about it. It’s kind of, like, it’s something that happened in China, and it’s going to stay in China. Then, come the beginning of March, it was Seattle. And then, the next morning I went to work. And now everybody at work is talking about it. But still — most of us, as refugees, immigrants, it’s, like — it’s probably, you know, people are maybe just being extra about it right now. Maybe it’s not that bad.Why do you think you reacted that way?For me, personally, I’m, like, OK. If it becomes to effect, I’m like, I’ve been through so much. If this is just like a virus, you’re talking to someone who had malaria, you know? I survived that. So it’s like, OK, if it’s going to be like malaria, I can go through it. It’s just going to be like any other thing that I’ve been through.But then, on Saturday, March 21, things start to change at Smithfield.When I went to work that morning, I saw a lot of people cleaning up the handrails, doors, bathroom doors with wipes. And then, I’m, like, what’s going on? And one of the people told me, yeah, this thing is serious, Achut. This thing is serious. But you know, I’m thinking now, OK, 150 to 160 people in one shift. You’re sitting in the break room to where tables are very small. You have six people in one table.And then, later that day, she gets an email.That time was when I receive an email, a video, from the C.E.O.s, Smithfield C.E.O.Hi. I’m Ken Sullivan, president and C.E.O. of Smithfield Foods. I’d like to talk to you today about Covid-19, or coronavirus.So I watched the video from the C.E.O. about this virus is not coming from food.According to the F.D.A. and C.D.C., there’s no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted by food.And America need food. Every family need food. We don’t want people to struggle from hunger, let alone a virus.— American families. We feed millions of people every day, every single day. It’s a business with no shortcuts and no days off. Most of our team members work side-by-side on production lines in our facilities. We can’t stay home. We can’t telecommute. Food, after all, does not get made on the internet.So our company is not going to get shut down.We’re here. We’re always here. We’re a food company. And despite Covid-19, indeed, because of it, we’re working around the clock to do what we do best. And that’s deliver good food responsibly.How did it feel to you to have your job deemed essential in the middle of a pandemic, when people all over the country are panicking? You know? Your work is deemed fundamental to keeping the country going.At one point, I was negative about it. At one point, I was, like, wow. Do that mean my life don’t matter? And here I am, putting my life at risk coming to work, because people around the world need food.Uh huh.But I said, OK. I’m just going to have to stay positive. And if people need food and I’m able to do that for them, then I’m just going to put my life to God to protect me and not get sick. So I’m —Did you also consider just staying home from work and not going in?To be honest, I did not.I was just thinking of, no, I need this job. I need to keep working so I can support my family. And thinking about it now, it’s, like — it hurts.It hurts that you didn’t think about yourself?Yes. [SNIFFLES] Yeah.We’ll be right back.By the end of March, hospitals across the country are being overrun by Covid patients. Governors start shutting down businesses and ordering people to shelter in their homes. But in South Dakota, there are still only a few Covid cases. And Achut is still going to work until Saturday, March 28.Now Saturday, my superintendents came up around, I would say, at about 3:00. And he said, OK, I want us to have a meeting.Uh huh.They asked me if I have any fever, cough, any, you know, shortness of breath. And I say, no, I’m doing good. And he said one of the machine operator tested positive. I say what?Wow.That person — I worked with her that morning for, like, I would say, about 15 minutes. They said, OK, well, you got to go home. Because you had close contact with her. And I’m, like, really? I didn’t say it out loud, but I’m thinking, they’re being silly. And that’s when they told me you’re going to be under quarantine for the next 14 days.Uh huh.But I’m still going to get paid 40 hours. Is that enough for me? It’s not enough for me as a person who do overtime. Overtime is, like, $500 extra. $500. That, for me, it covered a lot of things. What do I do? I can’t go and get another job. But at that time, I was told it’s just two weeks. So I’m, like, OK. Two weeks? You know, I’ll be OK. It’s still going to drop me back, one step backward. But I will be OK.Uh huh.And then, Monday night was when I got sick.Monday night, I went to bed feeling OK. I woke up about 2:00 a.m. with this sharp pain on my body. It just feel like someone stabbed me.So you know, I went to the bathroom. And I said, OK, maybe if I take a shower, a cold shower, it’s going to be better. So I turned the water on. And it just — when the water hit my body, it feel like a bunch of rocks was getting thrown on my body.So I turned the water off. I took the towel to dry myself and my skin. I just couldn’t use the towel, my skin hurt. So like, OK, I’m freaking out.And then, Thursday night, my body at this point is so exhausted. Even walking is, like, I’m pushing myself. I just feel like something heavy sit right on my chest. Now the fear really kicked in, because now I’m having problem breathing. I said, OK, it’s going to be better for me, I’m going to stay up. I don’t want to sleep. Because if I go to sleep, chances are going to be I’m not going to wake up.That’s when I left my room. I came to the living room and just sat there. Because I said, OK, if I stay in my room and I die, I don’t want my kids to find me dead in the room.What was that like for you emotionally?[SNIFFLES]I mean, what’s going through your mind?(CRYING) I went right back to my childhood, to everything that I’ve been through in life. But now, my kids — if I die, my kids will go through the same thing I’ve been through. The loneliness, you know, not having anybody to check into, like a parent. I’m thinking, I bring these kids to this world, I survive through everything that I went through. I said, I haven’t even had a chance to tell them they don’t know their mom.They don’t know what their mom went through. All they know is that my mom is a workaholic. She would do anything to give us a better life. That’s all they know. It’s not a perfect world. I’d make it perfect for them. But if I die, this world is not perfect anymore.It sounds like a horrible, horrible night.Yeah. It was. It was one of the worst night ever.So while Achut is at home, sick with the coronavirus, the situation at Smithfield is evolving.This Smithfield pork processing plant is now a coronavirus hot spot.More and more of her colleagues are falling ill.How many other cases do you hear about among your colleagues?Oh, a lot, a lot, a lot. I think within the South Sudanese community alone, I think we have, like, at least 40 people that I know. But in my department, I was told that it went up to 80. In one department, 80 people.And how big is your department?On a good day that people showed up, it’s 155.The outbreak at that Sioux Falls plant is among the worst clusters of coronavirus in the country. About 250 workers there tested positive for coronavirus.350 workers tested positive for Covid-19.And as the days pass, it keeps getting worse. The number of cases skyrockets up to more than 400 Smithfield workers who are sick. And the governor calls on the head of the company to stop production.One of the nation’s largest food processors, Smithfield Foods, will close its pork processing plant in South Dakota for further cleaning.So on April 12, the president of Smithfield announces he’s going to close the plant indefinitely. And all the workers are sent home.This morning there were fears the nation’s food supply chain is at a breaking point, after more than a dozen major meat processing plants have become Covid-19 hot spots.Meanwhile, food processing plants across the country are getting hit hard with Covid. Other major companies, like Tyson, start raising the alarm that they’re having trouble producing and delivering food to the nation’s grocery stores because of the virus.Meanwhile, President Trump announced an executive order to compel meat processing plants to remain open.And last week, President Trump signs an executive order declaring meat and poultry plants as part of the nation’s critical infrastructure, as a way to pressure the plants to keep producing food.In Sioux Falls, the plant is still closed. Smithfield says it will continue to pay workers for 40 hours a week until they go back to work. And it’s speeding up plans to reopen the plant as quickly as possible. But that’s also raised questions about whether it can do so safely.How are you feeling now, physically?Physically, I feel, I feel good. I’m still having a little bit of headache. But you know, that’s, like, almost an everyday thing when you are a mom. And you know? So I’m not freaking out over it. But my fever this morning is still at 100, and I have no idea why. I’m just trying to get it down to like, 99 at least, before I call my doctor to go for a check in. But I cannot afford to stay home for a long time. I would give myself a month. And if it goes after four weeks, no. It wouldn’t be good for me at all.It sounds like as soon as you start feeling better, your focus goes from your health back to your finances.Yes. That is correct.So now my focus is to try to take care of myself as possible, to where when this company opens back up, then I’m ready to go.

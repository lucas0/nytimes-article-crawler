The country has had just over 1,500 infections and 21 deaths, aided by a nationwide lockdown that lasted for more than a month.The government's effective response to the pandemic has buoyed the popularity of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with a Newshub-Reid Research poll showing her as the country's most popular prime minister in a century.New Zealand will also launch a contact-tracing app on Wednesday to help people track their movements, but the government said the data would not be shared with anyone besides the user.The daily number of infections has been falling steadily over the last few weeks since peaking in early April, with the country registering only 19 new coronavirus cases in May. No cases were reported on eight separate days in May. (Reporting by Renju Jose. Editing by Gerry Doyle)Advertisement

trusted	Michael Brown’s Shooting and Its Immediate Aftermath in Ferguson	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/12/us/13police-shooting-of-black-teenager-michael-brown.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	"Michael Brown Is Shot An 18-year-old teenager, Michael Brown, is shot and killed on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are in dispute. The police say Mr. Brown was shot during a skirmish with the officer. A friend who was walking with Mr. Brown, Dorian Johnson, says the officer opened fire when the young men refused to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk. He says Mr. Brown’s hands were over his head when the officer fired. All agree that Mr. Brown was unarmed. Protests Amid Calls for Patience After a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening, protesters flood into the streets near the scene of the shooting, some chanting, “No justice, no peace.” They are met by police officers in riot gear, carrying rifles and shields. A Peaceful Protest Turns Violent Images and videos captured on cellphones begin to flood social media sites, and accounts of looting in Ferguson spread quickly on Twitter. The QuikTrip in the second tweet, below, is among the first- and hardest-hit businesses. F.B.I. Opens Civil Rights Investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation opens a civil rights inquiry into the shooting of Mr. Brown on Monday as protests in Ferguson continues. The N.A.A.C.P. issues a statement of support for Mr. Brown's family, adding, ""Even as we call for accountability by those charged with protecting the community, we call on the community to act – collectively and calmly."" Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police, asks for patience while his department completes an investigation that could take some time. That night, protesters again square off with the police, who use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Police Decline to Identify Officer The police chief in Ferguson on Tuesday reconsiders his decision to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing concerns for the officer's safety. The department says threats were made against the officer and the city’s Police Department on social media. “The value of releasing the name is far outweighed by the risk of harm to the officer and his family,” the police chief, Thomas Jackson, says. The decision draws criticism from a lawyer for the Brown family. Anger Mounts Over Anonymity of Police Officer The selective release of information about the shooting, especially the anonymity granted to the officer, fuels a fourth day and night of protests in Ferguson that escalates after the police seeks to disperse people using rubber bullets and tear gas. Thomas Jackson, Ferguson's chief of police, reveals earlier in the day that the officer who shot Mr. Brown had been struck in the face during the encounter and treated at a hospital. The friend who was with Mr. Brown at the time of the shooting has disputed the Police Department's claim that there was a struggle. Among those arrested in the evening are Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, who are apprehended at a McDonald’s on suspicion of trespassing. They are later released without charges or an explanation. Both news organizations criticize the arrests. Also arrested is Antonio French , a St. Louis alderman who was documenting the protests on social media. Mr. French is released the next morning. A witness tweets this image of a street filling with clouds of tear gas, illuminated by what look like small explosions. Later, the police confirm that Molotov cocktails were thrown during the night. Shift in Oversight of Crowd Control President Obama says that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. “should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done.” Mr. Obama — who speaks from Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where he is vacationing — also criticizes law enforcement officers in Ferguson for what he describes as excessive force during the protests. He adds that he had spoken to Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri. “I expressed my concern over the violent turn of events,” the president says. Earlier in the day, Mr. Nixon speaks in Ferguson and promises ""operational shifts,"" saying that St. Louis County police officers would be relieved of duty in Ferguson. Later, he confirms that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would begin overseeing security and crowd control during the protests. Dueling Police Statements as Anger Rises One day after roiling tensions over the police shooting of a black teenager began to subside, emotions flare anew on Friday as the police identify the officer involved but also release evidence that the victim was a suspect in a convenience store robbery moments before being shot. The manner in which the police here release the information, which include a 19-page police report on the robbery but no new details about the shooting, leads to the spectacle of dueling police news conferences, one led by a white officer who seems ill at ease and defensive, and the other dominated by a charismatic black officer who expresses solidarity with the crowd even as he pleads for peace. Governor Declares Curfew in Ferguson On Saturday, Gov. Jay Nixon cites looting when he declares a state of emergency and imposes a midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew on the St. Louis suburb. The announcement prompts cries of protest and anguish from some members of the public, with many of them arguing that a curfew would lead only to new and fierce confrontations. But Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, the state Highway Patrol commander whose officers have overseen public security in Ferguson since Thursday, says: “We won’t enforce it with trucks, we won’t enforce it with tear gas, we will enforce it with communication. We will be telling people, ‘It’s time to go home.’ ” Clashes Erupt as Some Protesters Ignore Curfew As the midnight curfew in Ferguson takes effect amid heavy rain, crowds that had filled some streets begin to disperse. But some clusters of people confront police officers lining the streets or riding in armored vehicles. The demonstrators chant: “We are Mike Brown! We have the right to assemble peacefully!” invoking the name of the 18-year-old fatally shot by the officer. Protesters toss at least one bottle rocket, according to the police, and at the apparent sound of gunshots, demonstrators scramble to safety. The police fire smoke canisters and tear gas at the crowds, and officials later say it was in response to the shooting, in which one man is critically wounded, apparently by another protester. Seven people are arrested and accused of failing to disperse. The governor of Missouri later says that the curfew was effective in helping to maintain a relative peace. Preachers, Passion and a Private Autopsy Despite the official pronunciation of a successful curfew, passions in Ferguson are hardly tamped down as the day wears on. First, word comes that officials have extended the curfew for at least one more night. Then, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announces that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy of Mr. Brown because of the “extraordinary circumstances” in the case. (A state autopsy has already been completed.) Later, the police, pastors and civil rights figures gather at churches, delivering passionate speeches and calls for change. Then, late in the evening, the preliminary results of a private autopsy performed on Sunday by Dr. Michael M. Baden at the request of Mr. Brown's family are revealed. (Prof. Shawn L. Parcells assists Dr. Baden.) The 18-year-old was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, the report says. All the bullets were fired into his front. One bullet entered the top of his skull, suggesting his head was bent forward when it struck him, and caused a fatal injury. ""This information could have been released on Day 1,” Dr. Baden says in an interview after the autopsy. Amid appeals for calm, and as the second midnight curfew approaches, street violence flares again. Governor Deploys National Guard President Obama dispatched Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to Missouri after the governor deployed the National Guard to help the police quell unrest. The governor, Jay Nixon, also lifted a curfew that had been imposed on Friday night. Mr. Holder will travel to Ferguson on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said, and Ronald Davis, the director of the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, will arrive Tuesday to work with police officials. President Obama told reporters at the White House that he had talked to Mr. Nixon and expressed “an interest in making sure that if in fact the National Guard is used, it is used in a limited and appropriate way.” “I’ll be watching over the next several days, to assess whether, in fact, it’s helping rather than hindering progress in Ferguson,” Mr. Obama said. The role of the National Guard will be limited to protecting the police command center here, which the authorities said came under a coordinated attack on Sunday night, Mr. Nixon said. Unrest Escalates Despite Presence of National Guard The protests in Ferguson reached new levels of violence, even as the Missouri National Guard arrived, the latest in a series of quickly shifting attempts to quell the chaos. The authorities had banned stationary protests, even during the day, ordering demonstrators to continue walking — particularly in an area near where the shooting occurred. Reports of tear gas, rubber bullets and the exchange of live gunfire began to flood Twitter. In the morning Ferguson's streets were relatively quiet, but officials revealed that during the protests of the previous evening, two men were shot in the crowd, and 31 people — some from New York and California — were arrested. Six journalists were among those who were detained. Fires were reported in two places. The police were shot at, the authorities said, but did not fire their weapons. Focus Turns to Investigation as Holder Arrives Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis to meet with community leaders and federal investigators as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest. A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County. National Guard Troops Ordered to Withdraw Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin a withdrawal from Ferguson, signaling that the authorities believed that they had largely restored order after nearly two weeks of unrest. In a statement, Mr. Nixon said the situation had “greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside agitators interfering with peaceful protesters and fewer acts of violence.” In Washington, having returned from his trip to Ferguson, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. indicated that the federal effort was moving forward. “It’s going to take time for us to develop all the facts, develop all the evidence and see where the case will ultimately go,” he said. “It’s most important that we get it right.” Ferguson Area Schools Prepare for Opening Day The school year in Ferguson was scheduled to begin on Aug. 14, but the opening was delayed because of the unrest that followed the killing of Michael Brown five days earlier. Public schools will open on Monday, and teachers and administrators in the Ferguson-Florissant School District are eager to establish some sense of normalcy. Mourning and Calls for Action at Michael Brown's Funeral Thousands paid their respects to Michael Brown, more than two weeks after he was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. In a deeply religious service at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, several speakers exhorted mourners to work for justice, not just for Mr. Brown but for others, long after the funeral was over. The crowd of mourners included his parents and extended family, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the film director Spike Lee; T. D. Jakes, the bishop of The Potter’s House, an African-American megachurch; several members of Congress; representatives from the White House; and two children of the Rev.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Hello? Hello?

michael barbaro

Today, the death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and my colleague Richard Fausset’s investigation into it. It’s Monday, May 11. Richard, how did you first hear about this story?

richard fausset

I learned about this story in early April. I was up to my eyeballs in coronavirus coverage, along with my other colleagues in the national desk. And on April 2, my colleague Kim Severson, a food writer for The Times here in Atlanta, and a dear friend of mine, sent me a very brief note. And it said, “Look, you are busy. But this one’s looking pretty troubling.” She included a link to a story in The Brunswick News down in Brunswick, Georgia. And it looked to be a story of two armed white men, who were chasing an unarmed black man by the name of a Ahmaud Arbery through their neighborhood, and that that chase ended with a confrontation and with the black man being killed. The local coverage also showed that one of the men who was involved in this chase was a former police officer on the county police force, who had also spent years as an investigator in the district attorney’s office. And although the shooting had occurred on February 23, here we are in April, and no one had been arrested for it. It was very disturbing. And it seemed like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And I really didn’t know if I could answer them. But I had to set it aside for a while, just because we had this avalanche of news rolling in. So 10 or 11 days after getting this initial email from Kim, I started filing a flurry of open records requests. And I had a sense of what I was pretty sure I could get from this from covering previous controversial shootings in Georgia. I knew that I should be able to get a copy of the incident report, which is this brief summary that police file of what they saw when they arrived at the scene. I was pretty sure I could get the 911 call recordings, which I don’t think anybody had asked for yet. And then there was this other really just last-minute request that I filed. And I filed it with the county. And it was really just kind of a fishing expedition that I filed that turned out to be the most important public records request. And in that request, I asked for all of the emails to and from public officials from the day of the shooting up to mid-April.

michael barbaro

So essentially, you were trying to figure out if people in power in this community in the hours after this shooting are doing what you might expect them to do, which is saying oh, my god. Did you hear about this? What do we do? What do you think? That kind of thing.

richard fausset

Yeah. I thought maybe there would just be some chatter. They might have just been gossiping. You know, there just might have been a kind of, “oh, my god” kinds of emails. I didn’t quite know what to expect. But I think that was my first thought. So under Georgia law, all of those entities have three days to respond to my request. And of course, in an ongoing homicide investigation, there are a lot of things they can say that they’re not going to give me. So I talked to my editor, and we decided that I would wake up super early, drive down to Glynn County, Georgia — which is about four and a half or five hours from my home base in Atlanta — to a neighborhood called Satilla Shores, and do some social-distancing reporting. Satilla Shores is a middle-class neighborhood — you know, ranch houses and a few nicer homes that look like retirement homes. It’s kind of out of the way. There’s moss hanging from the oaks. I mean, it’s dramatically beautiful. And it kind of evokes Faulkner — I mean, Faulkner with ranch houses. And Satilla Shores is in the unincorporated part of Glynn County. Glynn County is a majority white place. It’s about 27 percent black. And like almost every part of the south, it has a very tragic and awful racial history, a history of lynchings of black men in the late 19th century. So I pulled up and parked my car near the McMichaels’ home. This is the home of the two men who chased Ahmaud. And almost as soon as I parked, a woman came out. And she started asking me what I was doing there. And I told her. She told me she’d called the police on me. And she told me she was armed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

You know, I think there was just a lot of tension in the neighborhood. And people were suspicious of my presence there. One very angry woman drove up to me as I was just walking the street and asked me repeatedly what I was doing there in a pretty hostile way. I came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

So on Thursday night, I drove back to Atlanta. And on Friday morning, I received the response to this last public records request that I had filed. And Michael, as you know, a lot of times, those kinds of public records requests just bring back just a bunch of dross, you know, just garbage.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

richard fausset

But in this case, when I opened this fat email attachment, I knew immediately that I had found something pretty explosive.

michael barbaro

What was that?

richard fausset

So the first document in this file was a three-page memo written by a district attorney in Waycross, Georgia named George Barnhill, who at the time was the prosecutor in the case. And the prosecutor in a case like this often advises the local police as to whether or not there’s sufficient probable cause to go to a judge and ask for an arrest warrant. Mr. Barnhill, in this letter, laid out an extensive justification — legal justification — for why he believed there was not sufficient probable cause to issue any arrest warrants for anyone. And his argument was that Mr. Arbery had committed a burglary, and that the men who pursued him were justified in pursuing him under Georgia’s Citizen Arrest law. It said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun. He had initiated the fight. And Travis McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself under Georgia’s Use-of-Force statute. And it said, of course, that the men were legally armed under Georgia’s open-carry law. But there were a lot of pieces of this that I knew a lot of lawyers and even other prosecutors were very likely going to take issue with.

michael barbaro

So in this prosecutor’s telling, everything that these two men did in this interaction that resulted in Arbery’s death, despite the fact that he was unarmed, was completely legal. They were allowed to carry the guns. They were allowed to make a citizen’s arrest. They were allowed, in his telling, to defend themselves from this unarmed man.

richard fausset

In Mr. Barnhill’s words, it was his conclusion there was insufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants at the time.

michael barbaro

And in your mind, what makes this so explosive?

richard fausset

I mean, what’s explosive here is that you have this well-detailed legal justification for an action that I knew many people would see as one that just violates their basic sense of what’s right. You had two armed white men in a truck chasing after an unarmed black man in a suburb in the deep south. There’s a confrontation. The black man is shot and killed. And no one has been arrested. And there’s an argument now, a legal argument, that no one should be arrested.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

richard fausset

So I reported my story about this case. And I included this information about this district attorney, who gave this legal justification for why no one should be arrested. It also included the fact that, by that point, that district attorney had recused himself for a conflict of interest. It turns out that his son worked in the local district attorney’s office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery. And the reaction to this story was pretty strong. But we were also in the midst of a pandemic. And we were social distancing. And the country was locked down. And so the kinds of protests that we’ve seen crop up in big cities and in other places when issues like this come to light were not materializing.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And so it was sort of unclear, really, where this whole drama was headed. But then on Tuesday, a video emerged online. It was a 36-second video. And it showed the last violent moments of Ahmaud Arbery’s life. And that started to change everything.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Richard, what exactly does this video show?

richard fausset

The video appears to be shot from a moving car. And it shows a man running, presumably Ahmaud Arbery. He’s approaching a white pickup truck. There’s a man in the bed of the truck — Greg McMichael. And there’s a man standing outside the truck with a shotgun — his son Travis. Mr. Arbery jogs to the right, presumably in an effort to just get away from Travis McMichael. But they tangle, and it’s violent. And you can see the shotgun between them. There’s a shotgun blast and more fighting. They go offscreen for a moment. There’s a second shotgun blast and more fighting. And then there’s a third shot. And you can see Mr. Arbery turn as if to run further. But then you see him crumple and fall to the pavement.

michael barbaro

Richard, what do we know about where this video came from and who shot it?

richard fausset

The video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.

michael barbaro

So another man in the neighborhood, who was essentially chasing him?

richard fausset

Right.

michael barbaro

And how does this video and all those details you just described change our understanding of this event?

richard fausset

Well, it appears there’s some contradiction in the initial story that Greg McMichael laid out in the initial police report. In it, Mr. McMichael said that he and his son pulled up beside Ahmaud Arbery. And they shouted “stop,” and they’d been shouting it before. And it was at that moment that Travis McMichael gets out of the truck with his shotgun. But the video shows that they were actually waiting for him in the truck. He was being blocked in because you had a third man, the man with the cell phone video, who was chasing him.

michael barbaro

So it very much shows him being trapped by these pursuers.

richard fausset

Yeah, it looks like he’s trapped.

archived recording The shooting took place back in February. And at the time, it remained a largely local story. But all that changed yesterday. Some video of the shooting went viral on the internet.

richard fausset

I mean, it’s one thing to read about a man struggling for his life and being shot and killed. And I think, just emotionally, it’s just a totally different story when you see it.

archived recording (stacey abrams) I believe that there should be immediate investigation of charges. It looks like murder.

richard fausset

Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial Democratic candidate in Georgia, spoke out about it in an interview. LeBron James, the basketball star, tweeted about it.

archived recording “We’re literally hunted every day, every time we step foot outside the comfort of our homes,” he said.

richard fausset

Joe Biden spoke about it in an interview.

archived recording (joe biden) Well, it sure looks like murder to me. At a minimum, it needs a thorough investigation. archived recording (brian kemp) Earlier this week, I watched a video depicting Mr. Arbery’s last moments alive.

richard fausset

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican who has created a lot of ill will among people of color, particularly in Georgia, for a very divisive campaign, talked about the need for Georgians to find justice in this case.

archived recording (brian kemp) I can tell you it’s absolutely horrific. And Georgians deserve answers.

michael barbaro

So just looking at this video, it seems pretty uncomplicated what’s going on here.

richard fausset

It’s not entirely uncomplicated. There’s another video that’s emerged. And this one appears to be a surveillance video from a house on the block. And it shows a man who appears to be Mr. Arbery going inside of a house that’s under construction near the McMichaels’ house. It’s sort of unclear what he’s doing there. And his family’s lawyer has said that, yes, he stopped by a house, by a property that was under construction while he was jogging. But still, the idea of an unarmed man out for a jog being chased down and killed by armed civilians, no matter what he was doing in the midst of the jog, is really what’s resonated so widely. And in fact, it’s become very much a rallying cry.

archived recording I’m running for Ahmaud today. He’s the young man that was gunned down in Georgia while jogging.

richard fausset

People were going out and jogging in solidarity with Ahmaud. They were using the hashtag, “I run with Ahmaud.”

richard fausset

They’re running 2.23 miles as a way of noting the day that he was killed: February 23.

archived recording (protestors) No justice, no peace. No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

And then late last week —

archived recording (protestors) No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

— hundreds of protesters gathered in the streets of Glynn County, Georgia in masks and gloves.

archived recording This is about corruption and cover-up by the Glynn County Police Department.

richard fausset

It felt like the ball was rolling downhill and gathering force every moment.

archived recording (protestors) This is not a murder. This was an assassination.

michael barbaro

At this point, Richard, how are people thinking about this case? And how is that differing from the way that it was first described in that memo that you unearthed with your public records request?

richard fausset

So I think what you saw from this mass protest was a fundamental disagreement with the legal analysis in this document that I dug up. People were calling this a lynching. They were evoking the context of the southern past and the American present. They just thought it was wrong.

michael barbaro

And at this point, as these protests are mounting, what is the status of the legal case?

richard fausset

Well, a lot starts happening. In my original reporting on this case, I noted that the D.A., George Barnhill, had recused himself. And there was a new prosecutor. As just the interest in this case exploded last week, he announced that he thought that the case should be presented to a grand jury in Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges being brought against the men involved in Mr. Arbery’s death.

michael barbaro

So that’s a very big change from the last prosecutor on the case.

richard fausset

Right. This is a total 180. He also invited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved. And the bureau launched its own independent investigation. And by Thursday night, Greg McMichael and his son had been arrested and charged with murder.

[music]

michael barbaro

What’s fascinating about that is that the video seems to describe what had been laid out in your reporting and in these legal documents beforehand. Right? There’s not a giant gap between them.

richard fausset

Yeah. I think what this video did is it really moved this case from the local stage to a global stage. And although we can’t know, for now at least, what the reasoning of this new district attorney was for saying the case needs to go before a grand jury, for indeed arresting these men, there’s no question that he’s now making decisions in a universe where many more people are paying very close attention.

michael barbaro

Right. It was no longer a local prosecutor writing a memo explaining why no one should be prosecuted, knowing that no one was paying all that much attention.

richard fausset

Right. For me, it was just a very surreal moment because I’m thinking back to that moment, which is a very private one. I’m in my house. The country is locked down. This email comes. And it has this very controversial legal opinion from a very obscure prosecutor.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And I felt like one person in on a conversation in a very closed and constrained system. And now, it seems like this whole story has just been blown out into the open.

michael barbaro

So Richard, where does this case stand right now?

richard fausset

So the McMichaels are currently in a jail in Glynn County. They haven’t had a chance to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. But the pandemic is still playing a role here. The Georgia court system has declared that a grand jury can’t be impaneled due to the coronavirus until after June 12, and that that stay could be extended at the discretion of the chief justice of the State Supreme Court if the pandemic continues to linger.

michael barbaro

What has been the response from Ahmaud Arbery’s family?

richard fausset

Ahmaud’s mother, Wanda Cooper, has maintained from the beginning that she believes her son, who was known to stay in good shape, was simply out for a jog. And I think there is some sense of relief that arrests have finally been made in this case after so many weeks of waiting. But I think they know that they’re only at the beginning of a new stage in this case and it could take a very long time to see it to its end.

[music]

michael barbaro

Richard, what do you make of this case that you have now been working on for about a month or more?

richard fausset

Well, it’s hard not to talk about this case without talking about the historical context of extrajudicial killings of people of color in the south and in the whole country. And I think a lot of people were shocked and dismayed by the details of this case. But they weren’t necessarily shocked that it happened. And I think one of the things that we’re starting to sketch out here are the systems in place, things like Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law, that might allow for the perpetuation of these kinds of problems. And I think even though we’re all looking closely at these systems, no one’s sure whether this story, as tragic as it is, may in the end serve to change them.

michael barbaro

Richard, thank you very much.

richard fausset

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Friday, a lawyer representing Ahmaud Arbery’s family called for a civil rights investigation, focused not only on the men who pursued and shot him, but the broader justice system that took weeks to prosecute them. On Sunday night, Georgia’s attorney general asked the federal government to conduct a similar investigation.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

The Trump Administration is trying to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus inside the White House after an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a valet to President Trump tested positive. That has prompted at least three top officials leading the government’s response to the pandemic, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, to begin two weeks of self-quarantine.

archived recording Do you wear a mask? Are you going to continue to show up for work at the White House? archived recording (kevin hassett) You know, I’ve got a mask right here. And the fact is that I practice aggressive social distancing. I’ll wear a mask when I feel it’s necessary.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Hello? Hello?

michael barbaro

Today, the death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and my colleague Richard Fausset’s investigation into it. It’s Monday, May 11. Richard, how did you first hear about this story?

richard fausset

I learned about this story in early April. I was up to my eyeballs in coronavirus coverage, along with my other colleagues in the national desk. And on April 2, my colleague Kim Severson, a food writer for The Times here in Atlanta, and a dear friend of mine, sent me a very brief note. And it said, “Look, you are busy. But this one’s looking pretty troubling.” She included a link to a story in The Brunswick News down in Brunswick, Georgia. And it looked to be a story of two armed white men, who were chasing an unarmed black man by the name of a Ahmaud Arbery through their neighborhood, and that that chase ended with a confrontation and with the black man being killed. The local coverage also showed that one of the men who was involved in this chase was a former police officer on the county police force, who had also spent years as an investigator in the district attorney’s office. And although the shooting had occurred on February 23, here we are in April, and no one had been arrested for it. It was very disturbing. And it seemed like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And I really didn’t know if I could answer them. But I had to set it aside for a while, just because we had this avalanche of news rolling in. So 10 or 11 days after getting this initial email from Kim, I started filing a flurry of open records requests. And I had a sense of what I was pretty sure I could get from this from covering previous controversial shootings in Georgia. I knew that I should be able to get a copy of the incident report, which is this brief summary that police file of what they saw when they arrived at the scene. I was pretty sure I could get the 911 call recordings, which I don’t think anybody had asked for yet. And then there was this other really just last-minute request that I filed. And I filed it with the county. And it was really just kind of a fishing expedition that I filed that turned out to be the most important public records request. And in that request, I asked for all of the emails to and from public officials from the day of the shooting up to mid-April.

michael barbaro

So essentially, you were trying to figure out if people in power in this community in the hours after this shooting are doing what you might expect them to do, which is saying oh, my god. Did you hear about this? What do we do? What do you think? That kind of thing.

richard fausset

Yeah. I thought maybe there would just be some chatter. They might have just been gossiping. You know, there just might have been a kind of, “oh, my god” kinds of emails. I didn’t quite know what to expect. But I think that was my first thought. So under Georgia law, all of those entities have three days to respond to my request. And of course, in an ongoing homicide investigation, there are a lot of things they can say that they’re not going to give me. So I talked to my editor, and we decided that I would wake up super early, drive down to Glynn County, Georgia — which is about four and a half or five hours from my home base in Atlanta — to a neighborhood called Satilla Shores, and do some social-distancing reporting. Satilla Shores is a middle-class neighborhood — you know, ranch houses and a few nicer homes that look like retirement homes. It’s kind of out of the way. There’s moss hanging from the oaks. I mean, it’s dramatically beautiful. And it kind of evokes Faulkner — I mean, Faulkner with ranch houses. And Satilla Shores is in the unincorporated part of Glynn County. Glynn County is a majority white place. It’s about 27 percent black. And like almost every part of the south, it has a very tragic and awful racial history, a history of lynchings of black men in the late 19th century. So I pulled up and parked my car near the McMichaels’ home. This is the home of the two men who chased Ahmaud. And almost as soon as I parked, a woman came out. And she started asking me what I was doing there. And I told her. She told me she’d called the police on me. And she told me she was armed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

You know, I think there was just a lot of tension in the neighborhood. And people were suspicious of my presence there. One very angry woman drove up to me as I was just walking the street and asked me repeatedly what I was doing there in a pretty hostile way. I came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

So on Thursday night, I drove back to Atlanta. And on Friday morning, I received the response to this last public records request that I had filed. And Michael, as you know, a lot of times, those kinds of public records requests just bring back just a bunch of dross, you know, just garbage.

michael barbaro

It said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun. He had initiated the fight.

So I reported my story about this case. And I included this information about this district attorney, who gave this legal justification for why no one should be arrested. It also included the fact that, by that point, that district attorney had recused himself for a conflict of interest. It turns out that his son worked in the local district attorney’s office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery. And the reaction to this story was pretty strong.

michael barbaro

Richard, what do we know about where this video came from and who shot it?

richard fausset

The video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.

michael barbaro

So another man in the neighborhood, who was essentially chasing him?

richard fausset

Right.

michael barbaro

And how does this video and all those details you just described change our understanding of this event?

richard fausset

Well, it appears there’s some contradiction in the initial story that Greg McMichael laid out in the initial police report. In it, Mr. McMichael said that he and his son pulled up beside Ahmaud Arbery. And they shouted “stop,” and they’d been shouting it before. And it was at that moment that Travis McMichael gets out of the truck with his shotgun. But the video shows that they were actually waiting for him in the truck. He was being blocked in because you had a third man, the man with the cell phone video, who was chasing him.

richard fausset

It felt like the ball was rolling downhill and gathering force every moment.

archived recording (protestors) This is not a murder. This was an assassination.

michael barbaro

At this point, Richard, how are people thinking about this case? And how is that differing from the way that it was first described in that memo that you unearthed with your public records request?

richard fausset

So I think what you saw from this mass protest was a fundamental disagreement with the legal analysis in this document that I dug up. People were calling this a lynching. They were evoking the context of the southern past and the American present. They just thought it was wrong.

michael barbaro

And at this point, as these protests are mounting, what is the status of the legal case?

richard fausset

Well, a lot starts happening. In my original reporting on this case, I noted that the D.A., George Barnhill, had recused himself. And there was a new prosecutor. As just the interest in this case exploded last week, he announced that he thought that the case should be presented to a grand jury in Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges being brought against the men involved in Mr. Arbery’s death.

michael barbaro

So that’s a very big change from the last prosecutor on the case.

richard fausset

Right. This is a total 180. He also invited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved. And the bureau launched its own independent investigation. And by Thursday night, Greg McMichael and his son had been arrested and charged with murder.

[music]

michael barbaro

What’s fascinating about that is that the video seems to describe what had been laid out in your reporting and in these legal documents beforehand. Right? There’s not a giant gap between them.

richard fausset

Yeah. I think what this video did is it really moved this case from the local stage to a global stage. And although we can’t know, for now at least, what the reasoning of this new district attorney was for saying the case needs to go before a grand jury, for indeed arresting these men, there’s no question that he’s now making decisions in a universe where many more people are paying very close attention.

michael barbaro

Right. It was no longer a local prosecutor writing a memo explaining why no one should be prosecuted, knowing that no one was paying all that much attention.

richard fausset

Right. For me, it was just a very surreal moment because I’m thinking back to that moment, which is a very private one. I’m in my house. The country is locked down. This email comes. And it has this very controversial legal opinion from a very obscure prosecutor.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And I felt like one person in on a conversation in a very closed and constrained system. And now, it seems like this whole story has just been blown out into the open.

michael barbaro

So Richard, where does this case stand right now?

richard fausset

So the McMichaels are currently in a jail in Glynn County. They haven’t had a chance to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. But the pandemic is still playing a role here. The Georgia court system has declared that a grand jury can’t be impaneled due to the coronavirus until after June 12, and that that stay could be extended at the discretion of the chief justice of the State Supreme Court if the pandemic continues to linger.

michael barbaro

What has been the response from Ahmaud Arbery’s family?

richard fausset

Ahmaud’s mother, Wanda Cooper, has maintained from the beginning that she believes her son, who was known to stay in good shape, was simply out for a jog. And I think there is some sense of relief that arrests have finally been made in this case after so many weeks of waiting. But I think they know that they’re only at the beginning of a new stage in this case and it could take a very long time to see it to its end.

[music]

michael barbaro

Richard, what do you make of this case that you have now been working on for about a month or more?

richard fausset

Well, it’s hard not to talk about this case without talking about the historical context of extrajudicial killings of people of color in the south and in the whole country. And I think a lot of people were shocked and dismayed by the details of this case. But they weren’t necessarily shocked that it happened. And I think one of the things that we’re starting to sketch out here are the systems in place, things like Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law, that might allow for the perpetuation of these kinds of problems. And I think even though we’re all looking closely at these systems, no one’s sure whether this story, as tragic as it is, may in the end serve to change them.

michael barbaro

Richard, thank you very much.

richard fausset

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Friday, a lawyer representing Ahmaud Arbery’s family called for a civil rights investigation, focused not only on the men who pursued and shot him, but the broader justice system that took weeks to prosecute them. On Sunday night, Georgia’s attorney general asked the federal government to conduct a similar investigation.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

The Trump Administration is trying to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus inside the White House after an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a valet to President Trump tested positive. That has prompted at least three top officials leading the government’s response to the pandemic, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, to begin two weeks of self-quarantine.

In an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to the president, acknowledged that a sense of fear has crept into the White House.

trusted	Where Ahmaud Arbery Ran, Neighbors Cast Wary Eyes	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/article/satilla-shores-ahmaud-arbery-killing.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	In February, 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead in the south Georgia neighborhood of Satilla Shores. In the two months that followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial profiling and flawed self-defense laws. “When they stop you, make sure you got your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.” Police did eventually arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of the fatal shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault. The case has reignited the national debate over racial violence. “I’m sure you saw the news about Ahmaud Arbery.” “It looks like murder.” “The American public saw the video.” What exactly happened in the last moments of Mr. Arbery’s life? Using security camera footage, cellphone video, and 911 calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed the critical 12 minutes from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla Drive to his death, less than 300 yards away. It’s around 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is out, less than 2 miles from his home. A security camera at 219 Satilla Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery enters the frame at around 1:04 p.m. He may have been jogging in the area, but he stops on the front lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being built across the street. Arbery glances around and wanders into the open construction site. Inside, security footage briefly captures him looking around. Meanwhile outside, a neighbor walks from Jones Road towards Satilla Drive and calls 911. The neighbor waits by the street corner. He will later tell the dispatcher that Arbery resembles a recent trespasser in the area. On multiple occasions before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught on camera at 220 Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On four occasions, what appears to be the same man was filmed. It’s unclear if this was Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify his shooting by neighbors outside on the street. The site’s owner says nothing was ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on Feb. 23, and no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of the trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in question. It’s 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street to 230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis and his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and leave the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don’t have footage showing the next 3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at the scene, and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate what happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto Burford Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in his car and follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery doubles back and passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but Arbery runs past him and toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael climbs from the cab to the bed of the truck armed with a handgun. We don’t know exactly what happens next. But Bryan and the McMichaels end up following Arbery on Holmes Road. And we next see Arbery at 1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes Road away from Roddy Bryan and toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is filming and — a warning — these scenes are distressing. Gregory McMichael dials 911 at this time. Let’s watch this back and break down what happens. This is Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles for almost 4 minutes. Travis is standing by the driver’s side of the truck, armed with a shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the 911 call. Arbery doesn’t know where to run. He veers right, then left and then darts around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes around the front of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the windshield and here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the instant the first shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right lung, ribs, and sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun. Gregory shouts: “Travis!” Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the truck, Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of frame. But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding. He throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the police report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon. He did not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting, and a minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew reports: Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground bleeding out. The police took Gregory McMichael’s testimony and let the two men go. But now the McMichaels both face serious charges. Hi, this is Malachy and I reported this story. For transparency, a note about the security footage used in this video, which was first published by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The time code you see here is incorrect. We know this because we lined up what we see in this video with what we hear in two 911 calls and we confirmed the time of those calls. These details and police logs also allowed us to determine that Gregory McMichael called 911 from his son’s phone just before the fatal shooting. So in this video, we used the real time that events happened. Thank you for watching.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The Justice Department will not bring federal charges against the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. Ashley Southall on why that decision was reached five years after “I can’t breathe” became a national rallying cry. It’s Wednesday, July 17. Ashley, tell me what happened on Tuesday.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Good morning. Thank you for coming today.

ashley southall

So the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Donoghue, whose office is based in Brooklyn, but also oversees Staten Island, came out and said —

archived recording (richard donoghue) Before I continue, let me say, as clearly and unequivocally as I can, that Mr. Garner’s death was a tragedy. For anyone to die under circumstances like these is a tremendous loss.

ashley southall

They’ve done an exhaustive review. They’ve looked at every piece of evidence, but —

archived recording (richard donoghue) But these unassailable facts are separate and distinct from whether a federal crime has been committed. And the evidence here does not support charging police officer Daniel Pantaleo or any other officer with a federal criminal civil rights violation.

ashley southall

— that they would not bring charges against any of the officers involved in Eric Garner’s death on July 17, 2014.

archived recording (richard donoghue) We know and understand that some will be disappointed by this decision, but it is the conclusion that is compelled by the evidence and the law.

ashley southall

He’s making this announcement one day before the fifth anniversary of Eric Garner’s death, which is important, because for the charge that they thought was appropriate in this case, they only had five years to decide whether to bring it.

michael barbaro

So this is basically the last possible moment to bring this charge.

ashley southall

Exactly. And at the end of the day, the prevailing consensus was that they could not do that in this case.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Consequently, the investigation into this incident has been closed.

michael barbaro

And remind us of the details of this case, of what happened to Eric Garner, where this case begins.

ashley southall

The case starts on July 17, 2014 on a hot summer day in Staten Island. The police say that a man by the name of Eric Garner has died during an attempt to arrest him. There’s no mention of any kind of use of force, no mention of a chokehold. And then the next morning, the police and the public wake up to this video.

archived recording (eric garner) Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. This stops today. archived recording This guy right here is forcibly trying to lock somebody up for breaking up a fight.

ashley southall

It shows two officers, Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo, approach Eric Garner on a street in Tompkinsville. And they accuse him of selling cigarettes. And he says, no, man, I’m not selling anything. I’m just minding my business. Leave me alone.

archived recording (eric garner) Everybody standing here. They’ll tell you I didn’t do nothing. I did not sell nothing.

ashley southall

This goes on for about 10 minutes.

archived recording (eric garner) You want to harass me? You want to stop me?

ashley southall

Officer Damico moves in to try to handcuff Eric Garner, and he flails his hands away. Then you have Officer Pantaleo attempt a takedown. They fall back into plate glass.

archived recording Hold on, hold on.

ashley southall

Mr. Garner’s 400 pounds. Officer Pantaleo is probably another 190, 200. The glass is going to buckle. So then they fall forward onto the sidewalk, and that’s where they get Mr. Garner prone and handcuff him. And other officers have arrived at the scene by then. There are about seven seconds when you see Officer Pantaleo’s arm around Eric Garner’s neck. At some point, he releases, and Mr. Garner is saying —

archived recording (eric garner) I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

ashley southall

I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. He ultimately says it 11 times.

archived recording Once again, police beating up on people.

ashley southall

E.M.S. eventually arrives. They don’t have any oxygen.

archived recording (speaker 1) Look, now, man, they gave this man a seizure. archived recording (speaker 2) No, move out the way. No. archived recording (speaker 3) It’s my brother. We live here.

ashley southall

And he was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

michael barbaro

What happens in the aftermath of this video being released?

ashley southall

So pretty much right away, there are calls for Officer Pantaleo to be fired and for him and other officers to be criminally charged, both for Eric Garner’s death, but also for the omissions of the use of force from official reports.

michael barbaro

Because until this video is released, the officers involved in the encounter, they haven’t mentioned any of the tactics that they’ve used.

ashley southall

Correct. And then three things happen simultaneously. The police Internal Affairs Bureau begins looking into the incident to see if any protocols were violated. At the same time, the Staten Island district attorney is looking at whether a crime was committed and then begins to present evidence to a grand jury. And at the same time, the feds are also looking in on these investigations, trying to see what evidence there is. But at that moment, they’re not yet investigating, because there’s a local process that has to play out.

michael barbaro

And when you say the feds, you mean the Department of Justice.

ashley southall

The Department of Justice.

michael barbaro

So my sense is that this is all moving as would be expected in a case like this. But what’s different is that a month after this happens, Michael Brown is shot in Ferguson and the issue of how police treat unarmed black Americans becomes a major national issue.

ashley southall

Correct. But it’s an issue that’s been bubbling up for some time. If you will reverse back to 2012, when Ramarley Graham was shot and killed by a New York City police officer, he was unarmed.

archived recording Officer Richard Haste was indicted for manslaughter, but a judge reluctantly threw out the indictment in May on procedural grounds.

ashley southall

Then, a few weeks later, you have Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a vigilante in Florida.

archived recording We have just learned that the jury has determined that Zimmerman is not guilty of any crime.

ashley southall

And then you have Eric Garner in July 2014, followed by Michael Brown that August.

archived recording The conclusion? That police officer Darren Wilson was not guilty of a crime when he shot Michael Brown to death on August 9.

ashley southall

And then you have Akai Gurley and Tamir Rice within days of each other.

archived recording A grand jury decided not to indict Timothy Loehmann, who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice.

ashley southall

So people are seeing this pattern of unarmed black men and boys, and even some women, being killed by the police and no one being held responsible or accountable for their deaths. And that is the backdrop for the decision by the grand jury in Staten Island in December 2014 that there isn’t enough evidence to prove that Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.

michael barbaro

So like the D.O.J. this week, the investigation by the Staten Island district attorney all the way back in 2014 finds that there’s not sufficient evidence.

ashley southall

Yes. And to the public, that’s infuriating. Because keep in mind that in the months between Eric Garner’s death in July and the grand jury’s decision in December, the public has learned that the medical examiner, who is a pathologist, deemed this a homicide. And they also learned that, for at least 20 years, chokeholds have been explicitly banned by the police department. And what people saw on that video was an officer using a banned chokehold and Mr. Garner dying.

archived recording (CHANTING) I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. And what do we know about how this grand jury decided not to press charges in what seemed to so many, from the video, like a clear-cut case?

ashley southall

One thing that the grand jury also heard that the public did not was testimony from Officer Pantaleo about what he intended to do. And he got up there in front of them and said that it was not his intent to use a chokehold. It was not his intent to harm Mr. Garner or to kill him. It was his intent to bring him down and affect an arrest as he had been ordered to do

michael barbaro

And that testimony, it sounds like, becomes important, the question of intent.

ashley southall

Yes, because the standard of proof in a criminal case is that the prosecutor needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer willfully acted in violation of the law, that it was an officer’s intent and his will to violate the law. And for that grand jury, the decision not to press charges indicates that the evidence didn’t meet that standard.

michael barbaro

And what about the fact that the use of a chokehold had been banned by police, regardless of intent? Didn’t he use an illegal practice? And wasn’t that weighed by the grand jury?

ashley southall

What Officer Pantaleo told the Internal Affairs Bureau, and later the grand jury, was that he wasn’t intending to use a chokehold. He said he was trying to use a seat-belt technique, which is a tactic approved by the N.Y.P.D. and taught at the Police Academy.

michael barbaro

It’s another kind of restraint?

ashley southall

Yes. And what his lawyers have also pointed out is that, whether it was a seat belt or a chokehold, once they’re on the ground and Mr. Garner begins to grunt and say, “I can’t breathe,” he releases him.

michael barbaro

So after the district attorney decides not to press charges, what happens to the case of Eric Garner?

ashley southall

So you’ll remember that this whole time, the Department of Justice has been watching the investigation play out. And once the local investigation is done, it’s now in their territory.

archived recording (eric holder) Good evening. I want to provide an update regarding the case involving Eric Garner.

And when the Department of Justice steps in, Ashley, what are they looking at? Is it a new question or are they basically investigating the same things as the city?

ashley southall

So what the grand jury in Staten Island was looking at was whether Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.

archived recording (eric holder) Now that the local investigation has concluded, I’m here to announce that the Justice Department will proceed with a federal civil rights investigation into Mr. Garner’s death.

ashley southall

Here, the federal government is looking at whether his crime was violating Eric Garner’s civil rights.

archived recording (eric holder) This afternoon, I spoke with the widow of Eric Garner to inform her and her family of our decision to investigate potential federal civil rights violations.

ashley southall

And in this case, there were two key things that they wanted to establish, or that they’d felt they needed to establish. One, that the force Officer Pantaleo used to subdue Mr. Garner was objectively unreasonable, that a police officer acting in those circumstances could have recognized what he did as just too much. And then the second thing that they wanted to establish was that his conduct was a willful violation of the law, that he knew the law and that he acted in a way that disregarded it.

michael barbaro

And by those measures, did the Department of Justice feel that it had a strong case to bring against this officer?

ashley southall

So this is the question that they were asking themselves over the more than four years that they were investigating this incident. And there was a lot of disagreement between mostly civil rights prosecutors in Washington, who thought that they should bring charges and thought that there was enough evidence there, and then the prosecutors in Brooklyn, who were going to be the ones who had to prosecute the case, who thought that it was not winnable.

michael barbaro

And what’s your understanding of why those two sides disagreed? What was Washington thinking? And what was New York thinking?

ashley southall

From what we know, it really came down to the willfulness. On the video, some prosecutors thought that the fact that Officer Pantaleo kept his arm around Eric Garner’s neck even after they were on the ground showed that he willfully disregarded the law. In Brooklyn, they were not so sure. And part of that, you can imagine, is from Officer Pantaleo’s testimony that his intent was not to hurt him. His intent was to arrest him. So all the while that prosecutors are conducting their investigation and dealing with these questions about whether they have a case and whether they can win it, the White House changes hands from President Obama to President Trump. We go through a series of attorneys general — Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions, who are all overseeing this case from Washington. And then you end up with Bill Barr, our current attorney general.

michael barbaro

And the decision ultimately —

ashley southall

Who ultimately makes the decision himself.

archived recording (richard donoghue) In order for a federal criminal civil rights charge to be brought, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer willfully used more force than he reasonably could have believed was necessary under the circumstances. And the law recognizes that police are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.

ashley southall

So one of the main questions of this case is whether or not Officer Pantaleo actually used a chokehold.

archived recording (richard donoghue) As Mr. Garner and Officer Pantaleo struggled, Officer Pantaleo held onto Mr. Garner and both men fell backward. In the process, Officer Pantaleo’s body slammed against a store window, causing the window to buckle.

ashley southall

And in this explanation, Mr. Donoghue said, yes, he did.

archived recording (richard donoghue) It appears that in response to that collision and to maintain a hold on Mr. Garner, Officer Pantaleo wrapped his left arm around Mr. Garner’s neck, resulting in what was, in effect, a chokehold.

ashley southall

But here’s how prosecutors dealt with that question.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Like many of you, I have watched that video many times. And each time I’ve watched it, I’m left with the same reaction.

ashley southall

There is an emotional side that looks at that tape and says —

archived recording (richard donoghue) That the death of Eric Garner was a tragedy.

ashley southall

That’s a tragedy.

archived recording (richard donoghue) The job of a federal prosecutor, however —

ashley southall

But then —

archived recording (richard donoghue) — is not to let our emotions dictate our decisions. Our job is to review the evidence gathered during the investigation, like the video, to assess whether we can prove that a federal crime was committed. At the end of the day, however, the video and the other evidence gathered in the investigation does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted willfully in violation of federal law.

ashley southall

What you see on video is very clearly an escalation by the officers to make this arrest for this very minor offense. And it ends with Mr. Garner dying. And so the net effect is that Mr. Garner’s punishment for allegedly selling cigarettes that day is death. That, in many people’s eyes, is too much. But in the eyes of the law, the prosecutors here, based not just on the video, but on the testimony of witnesses and the testimony of the officers, thought there just wasn’t enough.

michael barbaro

So Ashley, it’s been five years to the day that Eric Garner died during this interaction with the N.Y.P.D. And it now seems like prosecutors seem to have closed the book on this case. What, if anything, happens now? Is this case over?

ashley southall

Throughout these five years, Officer Pantaleo has been in a desk job without his gun or his badge. He hasn’t been out on patrol. And —

michael barbaro

He remains on the force.

ashley southall

Yes. There’s this process underway in the N.Y.P.D. that will ultimately end with the police commissioner, James O’Neill, deciding whether or not he gets to stay on the force as a police officer or if he has to leave. And he could allow him to resign. He could fire him. Or he could just dock him some vacation days. That decision could take weeks, it could take months, or it could happen tomorrow. We don’t know. But it’s not over for him.

michael barbaro

So what happens to him may end up being the accountability. It’s not going to happen in a courtroom, it seems. It’s not going to happen at the federal court level or the district attorney level, but it might happen inside the N.Y.P.D.

ashley southall

The Garner family has demanded for the last five years that Officer Pantaleo be fired. They have also asked for the other officers who were involved in his death and those who filed official reports that didn’t mention the chokehold, that didn’t mention any uses of force, should also be fired and held accountable.

archived recording (emerald snipes) I’m going to stand outside and I’m going to scream it. Pantaleo needs to be fired! He needs to be fired! Don’t apologize to me. Fire the officer. Don’t give me your condolences. I heard that five years ago. We want justice, and we want it today.

ashley southall

If that’s what the family wants, they have quite the mountain to climb. Officer Pantaleo is still on the force. Half of the officers’ names the family doesn’t know, because the city has withheld them. But the message from the family of Eric Garner today was loud and clear.

archived recording (gwen carr) This is what we have to live every day. And you know what? We’re not going to take this sitting down. archived recording That’s right. archived recording (gwen carr) This is not going down like this, because if it was one of their loved ones, it would have never went this far. So my son’s death is not going in vain. We’re going to fight this to the last straw if I’m the only one out on the street. And I’ve got all of these supporters behind me.

michael barbaro

Ashley, thank you very much.

ashley southall

Thanks for having me on.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording But you’ve stopped short of calling these comments racist. archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Well, the president’s not a racist. The president’s not a racist.

michael barbaro

On Tuesday, top Republicans in Congress rallied to the defense of President Trump, denying that his tweet calling on four Democratic congresswomen to return to the countries from which they came were bigoted and racist.

archived recording Mr. Leader, were the president’s tweets that said “go back” racist? Yes or no? archived recording (kevin mccarthy) No. And I do not —

michael barbaro

On Twitter, the president himself confronted the allegation, writing that, quote, “I don’t have a racist bone in my body.”

archived recording (nancy pelosi) Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets.

michael barbaro

Hours later, on the House floor, speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s attacks on Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

archived recording (nancy pelosi) To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people. I urge a unanimous —

Officer fired 6 cases Officer indicted or charged 8 cases Settlement reached 11 cases Officer convicted 3 cases

Cases in which black people were killed by the police or died in their custody have risen to national prominence in recent years, often prompting protests nationwide. This year, an off-duty Dallas officer fatally shot Botham Shem Jean when she mistook his apartment for her own, and Stephon Clark was shot dead in his grandmother’s backyard by the police in Sacramento.

To see how the cases were processed and moved through the judicial system, we tracked the outcomes of 15 high-profile deaths from 2014 to 2016. In some of the cases, the police offered an explanation for their actions, but many viewers of raw footage concluded that their actions were unjustified.

Officers were indicted or charged in eight of the cases. Three cases resulted in convictions, one of which came with a prison sentence after a guilty plea.

On Friday, Officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2014.

After a mistrial for murder or voluntary manslaughter charges in December 2016, Michael T. Slager, the North Charleston, S.C., officer who fatally shot Walter L. Scott in the back as Mr. Scott was running away, pleaded guilty to civil rights charges in May. He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter after Akai Gurley was killed by a ricocheting bullet in a dark stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project. The judge later reduced the conviction to criminally negligent homicide. Mr. Liang was sentenced to five years of probation.

After two mistrials, Cincinnati’s top prosecutor said in July last year that he would drop charges against a former University of Cincinnati police officer, Ray Tensing, who fatally shot Samuel DuBose in 2015 during a traffic stop. A judge later dismissed the charges.

In May of last year, Officer Betty Jo Shelby was found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black driver, in Tulsa, Okla.

In seven cases, no officers were charged, and they may never be. For example, in the case of Keith L. Scott, 43, who was shot during a confrontation with the police in the parking lot of his apartment complex in Charlotte, N.C., the prosecutor decided not to charge Officer Brentley Vinson, saying that the officer’s use of deadly force was justified.

In another case, Timothy Loehmann, the officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice in Cleveland, was never criminally charged in the death of the 12-year-old boy. But two and a half years after the shooting, Mr. Loehmann was fired for providing false information when he had applied for the job.

“Most police shootings are found to be legally justified,” said Philip M. Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University and a former police officer who tracks police crime.

“Under the relevant Supreme Court case law,” Mr. Stinson said, “if an officer has a reasonable apprehension of an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or deadly force being imposed against the officer or somebody else, then they’re justified in using deadly force.”"	15 Black Lives Ended in Confrontations With Police. 3 Officers Convicted.	2017-05-17	['Jasmine C.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The Justice Department will not bring federal charges against the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner. Ashley Southall on why that decision was reached five years after “I can’t breathe” became a national rallying cry. It’s Wednesday, July 17. Ashley, tell me what happened on Tuesday.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Good morning. Thank you for coming today.

ashley southall

So the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Donoghue, whose office is based in Brooklyn, but also oversees Staten Island, came out and said —

archived recording (richard donoghue) Before I continue, let me say, as clearly and unequivocally as I can, that Mr. Garner’s death was a tragedy. For anyone to die under circumstances like these is a tremendous loss.

ashley southall

They’ve done an exhaustive review. They’ve looked at every piece of evidence, but —

archived recording (richard donoghue) But these unassailable facts are separate and distinct from whether a federal crime has been committed. And the evidence here does not support charging police officer Daniel Pantaleo or any other officer with a federal criminal civil rights violation.

ashley southall

— that they would not bring charges against any of the officers involved in Eric Garner’s death on July 17, 2014.

archived recording (richard donoghue) We know and understand that some will be disappointed by this decision, but it is the conclusion that is compelled by the evidence and the law.

ashley southall

He’s making this announcement one day before the fifth anniversary of Eric Garner’s death, which is important, because for the charge that they thought was appropriate in this case, they only had five years to decide whether to bring it.

michael barbaro

So this is basically the last possible moment to bring this charge.

ashley southall

Exactly. And at the end of the day, the prevailing consensus was that they could not do that in this case.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Consequently, the investigation into this incident has been closed.

michael barbaro

And remind us of the details of this case, of what happened to Eric Garner, where this case begins.

ashley southall

The case starts on July 17, 2014 on a hot summer day in Staten Island. The police say that a man by the name of Eric Garner has died during an attempt to arrest him. There’s no mention of any kind of use of force, no mention of a chokehold. And then the next morning, the police and the public wake up to this video.

archived recording (eric garner) Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. This stops today. archived recording This guy right here is forcibly trying to lock somebody up for breaking up a fight.

ashley southall

It shows two officers, Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo, approach Eric Garner on a street in Tompkinsville. And they accuse him of selling cigarettes. And he says, no, man, I’m not selling anything. I’m just minding my business. Leave me alone.

archived recording (eric garner) Everybody standing here. They’ll tell you I didn’t do nothing. I did not sell nothing.

ashley southall

This goes on for about 10 minutes.

archived recording (eric garner) You want to harass me? You want to stop me?

ashley southall

Officer Damico moves in to try to handcuff Eric Garner, and he flails his hands away. Then you have Officer Pantaleo attempt a takedown. They fall back into plate glass.

archived recording Hold on, hold on.

ashley southall

Mr. Garner’s 400 pounds. Officer Pantaleo is probably another 190, 200. The glass is going to buckle. So then they fall forward onto the sidewalk, and that’s where they get Mr. Garner prone and handcuff him. And other officers have arrived at the scene by then. There are about seven seconds when you see Officer Pantaleo’s arm around Eric Garner’s neck. At some point, he releases, and Mr. Garner is saying —

archived recording (eric garner) I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

ashley southall

I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. He ultimately says it 11 times.

archived recording Once again, police beating up on people.

ashley southall

E.M.S. eventually arrives. They don’t have any oxygen.

archived recording (speaker 1) Look, now, man, they gave this man a seizure. archived recording (speaker 2) No, move out the way. No. archived recording (speaker 3) It’s my brother. We live here.

ashley southall

And he was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

michael barbaro

What happens in the aftermath of this video being released?

ashley southall

So pretty much right away, there are calls for Officer Pantaleo to be fired and for him and other officers to be criminally charged, both for Eric Garner’s death, but also for the omissions of the use of force from official reports.

michael barbaro

Because until this video is released, the officers involved in the encounter, they haven’t mentioned any of the tactics that they’ve used.

ashley southall

Correct. And then three things happen simultaneously. The police Internal Affairs Bureau begins looking into the incident to see if any protocols were violated. At the same time, the Staten Island district attorney is looking at whether a crime was committed and then begins to present evidence to a grand jury. And at the same time, the feds are also looking in on these investigations, trying to see what evidence there is. But at that moment, they’re not yet investigating, because there’s a local process that has to play out.

michael barbaro

And when you say the feds, you mean the Department of Justice.

ashley southall

The Department of Justice.

michael barbaro

So my sense is that this is all moving as would be expected in a case like this. But what’s different is that a month after this happens, Michael Brown is shot in Ferguson and the issue of how police treat unarmed black Americans becomes a major national issue.

ashley southall

Correct. But it’s an issue that’s been bubbling up for some time. If you will reverse back to 2012, when Ramarley Graham was shot and killed by a New York City police officer, he was unarmed.

archived recording Officer Richard Haste was indicted for manslaughter, but a judge reluctantly threw out the indictment in May on procedural grounds.

ashley southall

Then, a few weeks later, you have Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a vigilante in Florida.

archived recording We have just learned that the jury has determined that Zimmerman is not guilty of any crime.

ashley southall

And then you have Eric Garner in July 2014, followed by Michael Brown that August.

archived recording The conclusion? That police officer Darren Wilson was not guilty of a crime when he shot Michael Brown to death on August 9.

ashley southall

And then you have Akai Gurley and Tamir Rice within days of each other.

archived recording A grand jury decided not to indict Timothy Loehmann, who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice.

ashley southall

So people are seeing this pattern of unarmed black men and boys, and even some women, being killed by the police and no one being held responsible or accountable for their deaths. And that is the backdrop for the decision by the grand jury in Staten Island in December 2014 that there isn’t enough evidence to prove that Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.

michael barbaro

So like the D.O.J. this week, the investigation by the Staten Island district attorney all the way back in 2014 finds that there’s not sufficient evidence.

ashley southall

Yes. And to the public, that’s infuriating. Because keep in mind that in the months between Eric Garner’s death in July and the grand jury’s decision in December, the public has learned that the medical examiner, who is a pathologist, deemed this a homicide. And they also learned that, for at least 20 years, chokeholds have been explicitly banned by the police department. And what people saw on that video was an officer using a banned chokehold and Mr. Garner dying.

archived recording (CHANTING) I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. And what do we know about how this grand jury decided not to press charges in what seemed to so many, from the video, like a clear-cut case?

ashley southall

One thing that the grand jury also heard that the public did not was testimony from Officer Pantaleo about what he intended to do. And he got up there in front of them and said that it was not his intent to use a chokehold. It was not his intent to harm Mr. Garner or to kill him. It was his intent to bring him down and affect an arrest as he had been ordered to do

michael barbaro

And that testimony, it sounds like, becomes important, the question of intent.

ashley southall

Yes, because the standard of proof in a criminal case is that the prosecutor needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer willfully acted in violation of the law, that it was an officer’s intent and his will to violate the law. And for that grand jury, the decision not to press charges indicates that the evidence didn’t meet that standard.

michael barbaro

And what about the fact that the use of a chokehold had been banned by police, regardless of intent? Didn’t he use an illegal practice? And wasn’t that weighed by the grand jury?

ashley southall

What Officer Pantaleo told the Internal Affairs Bureau, and later the grand jury, was that he wasn’t intending to use a chokehold. He said he was trying to use a seat-belt technique, which is a tactic approved by the N.Y.P.D. and taught at the Police Academy.

michael barbaro

It’s another kind of restraint?

ashley southall

Yes. And what his lawyers have also pointed out is that, whether it was a seat belt or a chokehold, once they’re on the ground and Mr. Garner begins to grunt and say, “I can’t breathe,” he releases him.

michael barbaro

So after the district attorney decides not to press charges, what happens to the case of Eric Garner?

ashley southall

So you’ll remember that this whole time, the Department of Justice has been watching the investigation play out. And once the local investigation is done, it’s now in their territory.

archived recording (eric holder) Good evening. I want to provide an update regarding the case involving Eric Garner.

michael barbaro

And when the Department of Justice steps in, Ashley, what are they looking at? Is it a new question or are they basically investigating the same things as the city?

ashley southall

So what the grand jury in Staten Island was looking at was whether Officer Pantaleo committed a crime.

archived recording (eric holder) Now that the local investigation has concluded, I’m here to announce that the Justice Department will proceed with a federal civil rights investigation into Mr. Garner’s death.

ashley southall

Here, the federal government is looking at whether his crime was violating Eric Garner’s civil rights.

archived recording (eric holder) This afternoon, I spoke with the widow of Eric Garner to inform her and her family of our decision to investigate potential federal civil rights violations.

ashley southall

And in this case, there were two key things that they wanted to establish, or that they’d felt they needed to establish. One, that the force Officer Pantaleo used to subdue Mr. Garner was objectively unreasonable, that a police officer acting in those circumstances could have recognized what he did as just too much. And then the second thing that they wanted to establish was that his conduct was a willful violation of the law, that he knew the law and that he acted in a way that disregarded it.

michael barbaro

And by those measures, did the Department of Justice feel that it had a strong case to bring against this officer?

ashley southall

So this is the question that they were asking themselves over the more than four years that they were investigating this incident. And there was a lot of disagreement between mostly civil rights prosecutors in Washington, who thought that they should bring charges and thought that there was enough evidence there, and then the prosecutors in Brooklyn, who were going to be the ones who had to prosecute the case, who thought that it was not winnable.

michael barbaro

And what’s your understanding of why those two sides disagreed? What was Washington thinking? And what was New York thinking?

ashley southall

From what we know, it really came down to the willfulness. On the video, some prosecutors thought that the fact that Officer Pantaleo kept his arm around Eric Garner’s neck even after they were on the ground showed that he willfully disregarded the law. In Brooklyn, they were not so sure. And part of that, you can imagine, is from Officer Pantaleo’s testimony that his intent was not to hurt him. His intent was to arrest him. So all the while that prosecutors are conducting their investigation and dealing with these questions about whether they have a case and whether they can win it, the White House changes hands from President Obama to President Trump. We go through a series of attorneys general — Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions, who are all overseeing this case from Washington. And then you end up with Bill Barr, our current attorney general.

michael barbaro

And the decision ultimately —

ashley southall

Who ultimately makes the decision himself.

archived recording (richard donoghue) In order for a federal criminal civil rights charge to be brought, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer willfully used more force than he reasonably could have believed was necessary under the circumstances. And the law recognizes that police are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.

ashley southall

So one of the main questions of this case is whether or not Officer Pantaleo actually used a chokehold.

archived recording (richard donoghue) As Mr. Garner and Officer Pantaleo struggled, Officer Pantaleo held onto Mr. Garner and both men fell backward. In the process, Officer Pantaleo’s body slammed against a store window, causing the window to buckle.

ashley southall

And in this explanation, Mr. Donoghue said, yes, he did.

archived recording (richard donoghue) It appears that in response to that collision and to maintain a hold on Mr. Garner, Officer Pantaleo wrapped his left arm around Mr. Garner’s neck, resulting in what was, in effect, a chokehold.

ashley southall

But here’s how prosecutors dealt with that question.

archived recording (richard donoghue) Like many of you, I have watched that video many times. And each time I’ve watched it, I’m left with the same reaction.

ashley southall

There is an emotional side that looks at that tape and says —

archived recording (richard donoghue) That the death of Eric Garner was a tragedy.

ashley southall

That’s a tragedy.

archived recording (richard donoghue) The job of a federal prosecutor, however —

ashley southall

But then —

archived recording (richard donoghue) — is not to let our emotions dictate our decisions. Our job is to review the evidence gathered during the investigation, like the video, to assess whether we can prove that a federal crime was committed. At the end of the day, however, the video and the other evidence gathered in the investigation does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted willfully in violation of federal law.

ashley southall

What you see on video is very clearly an escalation by the officers to make this arrest for this very minor offense. And it ends with Mr. Garner dying. And so the net effect is that Mr. Garner’s punishment for allegedly selling cigarettes that day is death. That, in many people’s eyes, is too much. But in the eyes of the law, the prosecutors here, based not just on the video, but on the testimony of witnesses and the testimony of the officers, thought there just wasn’t enough.

michael barbaro

So Ashley, it’s been five years to the day that Eric Garner died during this interaction with the N.Y.P.D. And it now seems like prosecutors seem to have closed the book on this case. What, if anything, happens now? Is this case over?

ashley southall

Throughout these five years, Officer Pantaleo has been in a desk job without his gun or his badge. He hasn’t been out on patrol. And —

michael barbaro

He remains on the force.

ashley southall

Yes. There’s this process underway in the N.Y.P.D. that will ultimately end with the police commissioner, James O’Neill, deciding whether or not he gets to stay on the force as a police officer or if he has to leave. And he could allow him to resign. He could fire him. Or he could just dock him some vacation days. That decision could take weeks, it could take months, or it could happen tomorrow. We don’t know. But it’s not over for him.

So what happens to him may end up being the accountability. It’s not going to happen in a courtroom, it seems. It’s not going to happen at the federal court level or the district attorney level, but it might happen inside the N.Y.P.D.

The Garner family has demanded for the last five years that Officer Pantaleo be fired. They have also asked for the other officers who were involved in his death and those who filed official reports that didn’t mention the chokehold, that didn’t mention any uses of force, should also be fired and held accountable.

archived recording (emerald snipes) I’m going to stand outside and I’m going to scream it. Pantaleo needs to be fired! He needs to be fired! Don’t apologize to me. Fire the officer. Don’t give me your condolences. I heard that five years ago. We want justice, and we want it today.

ashley southall

If that’s what the family wants, they have quite the mountain to climb. Officer Pantaleo is still on the force. Half of the officers’ names the family doesn’t know, because the city has withheld them. But the message from the family of Eric Garner today was loud and clear.

Note: The officer who arrested Ms. Bland was charged with perjury. None of the employees in the jail where she died were charged.

These 13 cases have fueled outrage, heightened racial tensions and instigated protests around the nation. In some of the cases, the police offered an explanation for their actions, but raw videos led many to conclude that the police actions were unjustified.

So far, officers have been indicted or charged in seven cases . In four cases, grand juries declined to bring charges.

Officers in all 13 cases were placed on administrative leave or reassigned — a routine step that is not a form of discipline, said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Criminal charges have been brought against officers in fewer than half of the cases. Indictments are usually handed up by local grand juries, which make the decision in secret.

Courts have given leeway to the police on using deadly physical force if officers reasonably feel their lives are in danger, and juries are often reluctant to convict police officers, Mr. Dunn said.

Prosecutors may feel pressure not to charge officers because they work with and rely on the police daily, and at times, facts can be distorted or withheld by the police, leaving prosecutors with incomplete or wrong information, he said.

However, for victims’ families, “some action against the officer is very important to them, whether that’s criminal prosecution or dismissal from the department,” Mr. Dunn said.

Officer Betty Jo Shelby, 42, was charged with first-degree manslaughter after fatally shooting Terence Crutcher, 40, an unarmed black driver, in Tulsa, Okla. A county investigator said that Officer Shelby became “emotionally involved to the point that she overreacted.”

Officers who have been charged In the case of: Terence Crutcher Samuel DuBose Sandra Bland Walter L. Scott Laquan McDonald Betty Jo Shelby Ray Tensing Brian Encinia Michael T. Slager Jason Van Dyke Officers who have been charged In the case of: Terence Crutcher Samuel DuBose Sandra Bland Walter L. Scott Laquan McDonald Betty Jo Shelby Ray Tensing Brian Encinia Michael T. Slager Jason Van Dyke Officers who have been charged In the case of: Terence Crutcher Samuel DuBose Sandra Bland Walter L. Scott Laquan McDonald Betty Jo Shelby Ray Tensing Brian Encinia Michael T. Slager Jason Van Dyke

Former South Carolina police officer Michael T. Slager, who was recorded on video when opened fire on a fleeing black motorist, killing him, in 2015 pleaded guilty.

In the case of Freddie Gray, who died last year from injuries he suffered while in police custody, three of the six officers involved were acquitted of all charges, including one of murder. Prosecutors also dropped all charges against three other officers, ending one of the most closely watched and unsuccessful police prosecutions in the nation.

Officers acquitted in the Freddie Gray case Charges dropped Edward M. Nero Caesar R. Goodson Jr. Brian Rice Garrett E. Miller William G. Porter Alicia White Officers Acquitted in the Freddie Gray Case Edward M. Nero Caesar R. Goodson Jr. Brian Rice Charges Dropped Garrett E. Miller William G. Porter Alicia White Officers acquitted in the Freddie Gray case Charges dropped Edward M. Nero Caesar R. Goodson Jr. Brian Rice William G. Porter Alicia White Garrett E. Miller

After months of unrest and calls for his resignation, Officer Darren Wilson was cleared by a state grand jury and the Justice Department in the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, in Ferguson, Mo. Mr. Wilson eventually resigned, but said that he hoped “to continue in police work.”

In the case of Keith Lamont Scott, the prosecutor in Mecklenburg County, N.C., decided not to charge Officer Brentley Vinson, saying that his use of deadly force was justified because he feared for his life and those of his fellow officers.

Many of the victims’ families have agreed to settlements of $5 million to $6.5 million.

In settlements, police departments and cities rarely admit wrongdoing, said Joanna Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is an expert on police misconduct litigation. “Almost every settlement agreement states that there’s not an admission of fault,” she said.

Note: The University of Cincinnati settlement also includes an on-campus memorial to Mr. DuBose, college educations for his 12 children and an apology from the university’s president. The lawyer for Sandra Bland’s family announced on Sept. 15 that they had reached a $1.9 million settlement in their wrongful death civil suit. A lawyer for Waller County, Texas, noted that the settlement still needs to be approved by the county commissioners.

For the public, however, a large settlement is a clear signal that a city recognizes that something very wrong happened, Mr. Dunn said. “I don’t think any police department in the country pays out millions,” he said, “if they think they have done the right thing.”

“But it’s a mistake to equate settlement with police reform,” he added.

In many large cities, the settlements do not even come out of the police department’s budget. In New York, for example, payments are made from the city’s general funds, insulating the agency against any real consequences, said Gabriel P. Harvis, a civil rights lawyer and former lawyer for the city.

Civil rights investigations were opened in several cases.

Four of these cases, including last week’s fatal shooting of a black man in Baton Rouge, La., prompted the Justice Department to open civil rights investigations. In Baltimore and Chicago, the department opened broader investigations into the practices of the Police Departments.

Note: The Justice Department had already been investigating the Cleveland Police Department. Two weeks after Tamir Rice was killed, it said it had found a pattern of “unreasonable and unnecessary use of force” by officers. The Justice Department has said it is also reviewing the case.

Real justice, Mr. Dunn said, is ending police violence and holding officers who engage in violence accountable for their actions. “Police leadership makes a big difference, and so does litigation against a police department that challenges police behavior,” he said.

In Ferguson, federal officials and city leaders released an agreement in January seeking to overhaul the city’s justice system. The agreement came after months of negotiations stemming from the Justice Department’s scathing critique of the city’s police and courts after the shooting of Mr. Brown."

trusted	Investigators Say Man Who Filmed Arbery’s Killing Was More Than a Witness	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/ahmaud-arbery-william-roddie-bryan.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	In February, 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead in the south Georgia neighborhood of Satilla Shores. In the two months that followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial profiling and flawed self-defense laws. “When they stop you, make sure you got your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.” Police did eventually arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of the fatal shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault. The case has reignited the national debate over racial violence. “I’m sure you saw the news about Ahmaud Arbery.” “It looks like murder.” “The American public saw the video.” What exactly happened in the last moments of Mr. Arbery’s life? Using security camera footage, cellphone video, and 911 calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed the critical 12 minutes from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla Drive to his death, less than 300 yards away. It’s around 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is out, less than 2 miles from his home. A security camera at 219 Satilla Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery enters the frame at around 1:04 p.m. He may have been jogging in the area, but he stops on the front lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being built across the street. Arbery glances around and wanders into the open construction site. Inside, security footage briefly captures him looking around. Meanwhile outside, a neighbor walks from Jones Road towards Satilla Drive and calls 911. The neighbor waits by the street corner. He will later tell the dispatcher that Arbery resembles a recent trespasser in the area. On multiple occasions before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught on camera at 220 Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On four occasions, what appears to be the same man was filmed. It’s unclear if this was Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify his shooting by neighbors outside on the street. The site’s owner says nothing was ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on Feb. 23, and no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of the trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in question. It’s 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street to 230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis and his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and leave the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don’t have footage showing the next 3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at the scene, and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate what happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto Burford Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in his car and follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery doubles back and passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but Arbery runs past him and toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael climbs from the cab to the bed of the truck armed with a handgun. We don’t know exactly what happens next. But Bryan and the McMichaels end up following Arbery on Holmes Road. And we next see Arbery at 1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes Road away from Roddy Bryan and toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is filming and — a warning — these scenes are distressing. Gregory McMichael dials 911 at this time. Let’s watch this back and break down what happens. This is Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles for almost 4 minutes. Travis is standing by the driver’s side of the truck, armed with a shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the 911 call. Arbery doesn’t know where to run. He veers right, then left and then darts around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes around the front of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the windshield and here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the instant the first shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right lung, ribs, and sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun. Gregory shouts: “Travis!” Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the truck, Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of frame. But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding. He throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the police report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon. He did not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting, and a minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew reports: Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground bleeding out. The police took Gregory McMichael’s testimony and let the two men go. But now the McMichaels both face serious charges. Hi, this is Malachy and I reported this story. For transparency, a note about the security footage used in this video, which was first published by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The time code you see here is incorrect. We know this because we lined up what we see in this video with what we hear in two 911 calls and we confirmed the time of those calls. These details and police logs also allowed us to determine that Gregory McMichael called 911 from his son’s phone just before the fatal shooting. So in this video, we used the real time that events happened. Thank you for watching.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Hello? Hello?

michael barbaro

Today, the death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and my colleague Richard Fausset’s investigation into it. It’s Monday, May 11. Richard, how did you first hear about this story?

richard fausset

I learned about this story in early April. I was up to my eyeballs in coronavirus coverage, along with my other colleagues in the national desk. And on April 2, my colleague Kim Severson, a food writer for The Times here in Atlanta, and a dear friend of mine, sent me a very brief note. And it said, “Look, you are busy. But this one’s looking pretty troubling.” She included a link to a story in The Brunswick News down in Brunswick, Georgia. And it looked to be a story of two armed white men, who were chasing an unarmed black man by the name of a Ahmaud Arbery through their neighborhood, and that that chase ended with a confrontation and with the black man being killed. The local coverage also showed that one of the men who was involved in this chase was a former police officer on the county police force, who had also spent years as an investigator in the district attorney’s office. And although the shooting had occurred on February 23, here we are in April, and no one had been arrested for it. It was very disturbing. And it seemed like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And I really didn’t know if I could answer them. But I had to set it aside for a while, just because we had this avalanche of news rolling in. So 10 or 11 days after getting this initial email from Kim, I started filing a flurry of open records requests. And I had a sense of what I was pretty sure I could get from this from covering previous controversial shootings in Georgia. I knew that I should be able to get a copy of the incident report, which is this brief summary that police file of what they saw when they arrived at the scene. I was pretty sure I could get the 911 call recordings, which I don’t think anybody had asked for yet. And then there was this other really just last-minute request that I filed. And I filed it with the county. And it was really just kind of a fishing expedition that I filed that turned out to be the most important public records request. And in that request, I asked for all of the emails to and from public officials from the day of the shooting up to mid-April.

michael barbaro

So essentially, you were trying to figure out if people in power in this community in the hours after this shooting are doing what you might expect them to do, which is saying oh, my god. Did you hear about this? What do we do? What do you think? That kind of thing.

richard fausset

Yeah. I thought maybe there would just be some chatter. They might have just been gossiping. You know, there just might have been a kind of, “oh, my god” kinds of emails. I didn’t quite know what to expect. But I think that was my first thought. So under Georgia law, all of those entities have three days to respond to my request. And of course, in an ongoing homicide investigation, there are a lot of things they can say that they’re not going to give me. So I talked to my editor, and we decided that I would wake up super early, drive down to Glynn County, Georgia — which is about four and a half or five hours from my home base in Atlanta — to a neighborhood called Satilla Shores, and do some social-distancing reporting. Satilla Shores is a middle-class neighborhood — you know, ranch houses and a few nicer homes that look like retirement homes. It’s kind of out of the way. There’s moss hanging from the oaks. I mean, it’s dramatically beautiful. And it kind of evokes Faulkner — I mean, Faulkner with ranch houses. And Satilla Shores is in the unincorporated part of Glynn County. Glynn County is a majority white place. It’s about 27 percent black. And like almost every part of the south, it has a very tragic and awful racial history, a history of lynchings of black men in the late 19th century. So I pulled up and parked my car near the McMichaels’ home. This is the home of the two men who chased Ahmaud. And almost as soon as I parked, a woman came out. And she started asking me what I was doing there. And I told her. She told me she’d called the police on me. And she told me she was armed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

You know, I think there was just a lot of tension in the neighborhood. And people were suspicious of my presence there. One very angry woman drove up to me as I was just walking the street and asked me repeatedly what I was doing there in a pretty hostile way. I came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

So on Thursday night, I drove back to Atlanta. And on Friday morning, I received the response to this last public records request that I had filed. And Michael, as you know, a lot of times, those kinds of public records requests just bring back just a bunch of dross, you know, just garbage.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

richard fausset

But in this case, when I opened this fat email attachment, I knew immediately that I had found something pretty explosive.

michael barbaro

What was that?

richard fausset

So the first document in this file was a three-page memo written by a district attorney in Waycross, Georgia named George Barnhill, who at the time was the prosecutor in the case. And the prosecutor in a case like this often advises the local police as to whether or not there’s sufficient probable cause to go to a judge and ask for an arrest warrant. Mr. Barnhill, in this letter, laid out an extensive justification — legal justification — for why he believed there was not sufficient probable cause to issue any arrest warrants for anyone. And his argument was that Mr. Arbery had committed a burglary, and that the men who pursued him were justified in pursuing him under Georgia’s Citizen Arrest law. It said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun. He had initiated the fight. And Travis McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself under Georgia’s Use-of-Force statute. And it said, of course, that the men were legally armed under Georgia’s open-carry law. But there were a lot of pieces of this that I knew a lot of lawyers and even other prosecutors were very likely going to take issue with.

michael barbaro

So in this prosecutor’s telling, everything that these two men did in this interaction that resulted in Arbery’s death, despite the fact that he was unarmed, was completely legal. They were allowed to carry the guns. They were allowed to make a citizen’s arrest. They were allowed, in his telling, to defend themselves from this unarmed man.

richard fausset

In Mr. Barnhill’s words, it was his conclusion there was insufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants at the time.

michael barbaro

And in your mind, what makes this so explosive?

richard fausset

I mean, what’s explosive here is that you have this well-detailed legal justification for an action that I knew many people would see as one that just violates their basic sense of what’s right. You had two armed white men in a truck chasing after an unarmed black man in a suburb in the deep south. There’s a confrontation. The black man is shot and killed. And no one has been arrested. And there’s an argument now, a legal argument, that no one should be arrested.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

richard fausset

So I reported my story about this case. And I included this information about this district attorney, who gave this legal justification for why no one should be arrested. It also included the fact that, by that point, that district attorney had recused himself for a conflict of interest. It turns out that his son worked in the local district attorney’s office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery. And the reaction to this story was pretty strong. But we were also in the midst of a pandemic. And we were social distancing. And the country was locked down. And so the kinds of protests that we’ve seen crop up in big cities and in other places when issues like this come to light were not materializing.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And so it was sort of unclear, really, where this whole drama was headed. But then on Tuesday, a video emerged online. It was a 36-second video. And it showed the last violent moments of Ahmaud Arbery’s life. And that started to change everything.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Richard, what exactly does this video show?

richard fausset

The video appears to be shot from a moving car. And it shows a man running, presumably Ahmaud Arbery. He’s approaching a white pickup truck. There’s a man in the bed of the truck — Greg McMichael. And there’s a man standing outside the truck with a shotgun — his son Travis. Mr. Arbery jogs to the right, presumably in an effort to just get away from Travis McMichael. But they tangle, and it’s violent. And you can see the shotgun between them. There’s a shotgun blast and more fighting. They go offscreen for a moment. There’s a second shotgun blast and more fighting. And then there’s a third shot. And you can see Mr. Arbery turn as if to run further. But then you see him crumple and fall to the pavement.

michael barbaro

Richard, what do we know about where this video came from and who shot it?

richard fausset

The video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.

michael barbaro

So another man in the neighborhood, who was essentially chasing him?

richard fausset

Right.

michael barbaro

And how does this video and all those details you just described change our understanding of this event?

richard fausset

Well, it appears there’s some contradiction in the initial story that Greg McMichael laid out in the initial police report. In it, Mr. McMichael said that he and his son pulled up beside Ahmaud Arbery. And they shouted “stop,” and they’d been shouting it before. And it was at that moment that Travis McMichael gets out of the truck with his shotgun. But the video shows that they were actually waiting for him in the truck. He was being blocked in because you had a third man, the man with the cell phone video, who was chasing him.

michael barbaro

So it very much shows him being trapped by these pursuers.

richard fausset

Yeah, it looks like he’s trapped.

archived recording The shooting took place back in February. And at the time, it remained a largely local story. But all that changed yesterday. Some video of the shooting went viral on the internet.

richard fausset

I mean, it’s one thing to read about a man struggling for his life and being shot and killed. And I think, just emotionally, it’s just a totally different story when you see it.

archived recording (stacey abrams) I believe that there should be immediate investigation of charges. It looks like murder.

richard fausset

Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial Democratic candidate in Georgia, spoke out about it in an interview. LeBron James, the basketball star, tweeted about it.

archived recording “We’re literally hunted every day, every time we step foot outside the comfort of our homes,” he said.

richard fausset

Joe Biden spoke about it in an interview.

archived recording (joe biden) Well, it sure looks like murder to me. At a minimum, it needs a thorough investigation. archived recording (brian kemp) Earlier this week, I watched a video depicting Mr. Arbery’s last moments alive.

richard fausset

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican who has created a lot of ill will among people of color, particularly in Georgia, for a very divisive campaign, talked about the need for Georgians to find justice in this case.

archived recording (brian kemp) I can tell you it’s absolutely horrific. And Georgians deserve answers.

michael barbaro

So just looking at this video, it seems pretty uncomplicated what’s going on here.

richard fausset

It’s not entirely uncomplicated. There’s another video that’s emerged. And this one appears to be a surveillance video from a house on the block. And it shows a man who appears to be Mr. Arbery going inside of a house that’s under construction near the McMichaels’ house. It’s sort of unclear what he’s doing there. And his family’s lawyer has said that, yes, he stopped by a house, by a property that was under construction while he was jogging. But still, the idea of an unarmed man out for a jog being chased down and killed by armed civilians, no matter what he was doing in the midst of the jog, is really what’s resonated so widely. And in fact, it’s become very much a rallying cry.

archived recording I’m running for Ahmaud today. He’s the young man that was gunned down in Georgia while jogging.

richard fausset

People were going out and jogging in solidarity with Ahmaud. They were using the hashtag, “I run with Ahmaud.”

archived recording 1 This morning’s run, 2.23 miles. I run with Ahmaud, baby. archived recording 2 I run with Ahmaud. archived recording 3 2.23 — we with you, young king. archived recording 4 2.23 for Ahmaud. Let’s go. I haven’t run in 10 years, but I’m doing it.

richard fausset

They’re running 2.23 miles as a way of noting the day that he was killed: February 23.

archived recording (protestors) No justice, no peace. No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

And then late last week —

archived recording (protestors) No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

— hundreds of protesters gathered in the streets of Glynn County, Georgia in masks and gloves.

archived recording This is about corruption and cover-up by the Glynn County Police Department.

richard fausset

It felt like the ball was rolling downhill and gathering force every moment.

archived recording (protestors) This is not a murder. This was an assassination.

michael barbaro

At this point, Richard, how are people thinking about this case? And how is that differing from the way that it was first described in that memo that you unearthed with your public records request?

richard fausset

So I think what you saw from this mass protest was a fundamental disagreement with the legal analysis in this document that I dug up. People were calling this a lynching. They were evoking the context of the southern past and the American present. They just thought it was wrong.

michael barbaro

And at this point, as these protests are mounting, what is the status of the legal case?

richard fausset

Well, a lot starts happening. In my original reporting on this case, I noted that the D.A., George Barnhill, had recused himself. And there was a new prosecutor. As just the interest in this case exploded last week, he announced that he thought that the case should be presented to a grand jury in Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges being brought against the men involved in Mr. Arbery’s death.

michael barbaro

So that’s a very big change from the last prosecutor on the case.

richard fausset

Right. This is a total 180. He also invited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved. And the bureau launched its own independent investigation. And by Thursday night, Greg McMichael and his son had been arrested and charged with murder.

[music]

michael barbaro

What’s fascinating about that is that the video seems to describe what had been laid out in your reporting and in these legal documents beforehand. Right? There’s not a giant gap between them.

richard fausset

Yeah. I think what this video did is it really moved this case from the local stage to a global stage. And although we can’t know, for now at least, what the reasoning of this new district attorney was for saying the case needs to go before a grand jury, for indeed arresting these men, there’s no question that he’s now making decisions in a universe where many more people are paying very close attention.

michael barbaro

Right. It was no longer a local prosecutor writing a memo explaining why no one should be prosecuted, knowing that no one was paying all that much attention.

richard fausset

Right. For me, it was just a very surreal moment because I’m thinking back to that moment, which is a very private one. I’m in my house. The country is locked down. This email comes. And it has this very controversial legal opinion from a very obscure prosecutor.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And I felt like one person in on a conversation in a very closed and constrained system. And now, it seems like this whole story has just been blown out into the open.

michael barbaro

So Richard, where does this case stand right now?

richard fausset

So the McMichaels are currently in a jail in Glynn County. They haven’t had a chance to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. But the pandemic is still playing a role here. The Georgia court system has declared that a grand jury can’t be impaneled due to the coronavirus until after June 12, and that that stay could be extended at the discretion of the chief justice of the State Supreme Court if the pandemic continues to linger.

michael barbaro

What has been the response from Ahmaud Arbery’s family?

richard fausset

Ahmaud’s mother, Wanda Cooper, has maintained from the beginning that she believes her son, who was known to stay in good shape, was simply out for a jog. And I think there is some sense of relief that arrests have finally been made in this case after so many weeks of waiting. But I think they know that they’re only at the beginning of a new stage in this case and it could take a very long time to see it to its end.

[music]

michael barbaro

Richard, what do you make of this case that you have now been working on for about a month or more?

richard fausset

Well, it’s hard not to talk about this case without talking about the historical context of extrajudicial killings of people of color in the south and in the whole country. And I think a lot of people were shocked and dismayed by the details of this case. But they weren’t necessarily shocked that it happened. And I think one of the things that we’re starting to sketch out here are the systems in place, things like Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law, that might allow for the perpetuation of these kinds of problems. And I think even though we’re all looking closely at these systems, no one’s sure whether this story, as tragic as it is, may in the end serve to change them.

michael barbaro

Richard, thank you very much.

richard fausset

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Friday, a lawyer representing Ahmaud Arbery’s family called for a civil rights investigation, focused not only on the men who pursued and shot him, but the broader justice system that took weeks to prosecute them. On Sunday night, Georgia’s attorney general asked the federal government to conduct a similar investigation.

The Trump Administration is trying to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus inside the White House after an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a valet to President Trump tested positive.

In the two months that followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial profiling and flawed self-defense laws. “When they stop you, make sure you got your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.” Police did eventually arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of the fatal shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault. The case has reignited the national debate over racial violence. “I’m sure you saw the news about Ahmaud Arbery.” “It looks like murder.” “The American public saw the video.” What exactly happened in the last moments of Mr. Arbery’s life? Using security camera footage, cellphone video, and 911 calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed the critical 12 minutes from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla Drive to his death, less than 300 yards away. It’s around 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is out, less than 2 miles from his home. A security camera at 219 Satilla Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery enters the frame at around 1:04 p.m. He may have been jogging in the area, but he stops on the front lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being built across the street. Arbery glances around and wanders into the open construction site. Inside, security footage briefly captures him looking around. Meanwhile outside, a neighbor walks from Jones Road towards Satilla Drive and calls 911. The neighbor waits by the street corner. He will later tell the dispatcher that Arbery resembles a recent trespasser in the area. On multiple occasions before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught on camera at 220 Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On four occasions, what appears to be the same man was filmed. It’s unclear if this was Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify his shooting by neighbors outside on the street. The site’s owner says nothing was ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on Feb. 23, and no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of the trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in question. It’s 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street to 230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis and his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and leave the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don’t have footage showing the next 3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at the scene, and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate what happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto Burford Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in his car and follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery doubles back and passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but Arbery runs past him and toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael climbs from the cab to the bed of the truck armed with a handgun. We don’t know exactly what happens next. But Bryan and the McMichaels end up following Arbery on Holmes Road. And we next see Arbery at 1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes Road away from Roddy Bryan and toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is filming and — a warning — these scenes are distressing. Gregory McMichael dials 911 at this time. Let’s watch this back and break down what happens. This is Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles for almost 4 minutes. Travis is standing by the driver’s side of the truck, armed with a shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the 911 call. Arbery doesn’t know where to run. He veers right, then left and then darts around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes around the front of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the windshield and here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the instant the first shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right lung, ribs, and sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun. Gregory shouts: “Travis!” Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the truck, Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of frame. But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding. He throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the police report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon. He did not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting, and a minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew reports: Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground bleeding out. The police took Gregory McMichael’s testimony and let the two men go. But now the McMichaels both face serious charges. Hi, this is Malachy and I reported this story. For transparency, a note about the security footage used in this video, which was first published by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The time code you see here is incorrect. We know this because we lined up what we see in this video with what we hear in two 911 calls and we confirmed the time of those calls. These details and police logs also allowed us to determine that Gregory McMichael called 911 from his son’s phone just before the fatal shooting. So in this video, we used the real time that events happened. Thank you for watching.

What happened: Later that year, a grand jury cleared Officer O’Keefe, supporting the officer’s assertion that Mr. Garcia reached for a gun before he was shot.

Ernest Sayon April 29, 1994 Mr. Sayon, 22, was standing outside a Staten Island housing complex when police officers on an anti-drug patrol tried to arrest him. Mr. Sayon suffocated because of pressure on his back, chest and neck while he was handcuffed on the ground. What happened: A grand jury declined to file criminal charges against any of the three police officers involved, apparently concluding that the officers had used reasonable force in subduing Mr. Sayon.

Nicholas Heyward Jr. Sept. 27, 1994 Nicholas, 13, was playing cops and robbers with friends in a Gowanus Houses building stairwell when Officer Brian George, mistaking the teenager’s toy rifle for a real gun, shot him to death. What happened: The Brooklyn district attorney decided not to present the case to a grand jury, saying the real culprit was an authentic-looking toy gun.

Anthony Baez Dec. 22, 1994 Mr. Baez, 29, a security guard, was playing football outside his mother’s Bronx home when a stray toss landed on a police car. Mr. Baez died after an officer applied a chokehold while trying to arrest him. What happened: Francis X. Livoti, who had been dismissed by the force for using an illegal chokehold, was convicted on federal civil rights charges and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, two years after he won acquittal in a state trial.

Amadou Diallo Feb. 4, 1999 Mr. Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was killed by four officers who fired 41 times in the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx. They said he seemed to have a gun, but he was unarmed. What happened: In February 2000, after a tense and racially charged trial, all four officers, who were white, were acquitted of second-degree murder and other charges, fueling protests. The city agreed to pay the family $3 million.

Patrick Dorismond March 16, 2000 Mr. Dorismond, 26, an unarmed black security guard, was shot dead by an undercover narcotics detective in a brawl in front of a bar in Midtown Manhattan, after Mr. Dorismond became offended when the detective asked him if he had any crack cocaine. What happened: By late July, a grand jury declined to file criminal charges against the detective, Anthony Vasquez, concluding that the shooting of Mr. Dorismond was not intentional. The city agreed to pay $2.25 million to his family.

Ousmane Zongo May 23, 2003 Mr. Zongo, 43, an art restorer, was shot and killed by a police officer during a raid at a Chelsea warehouse that the police believed was the base of a CD counterfeiting operation. What happened: In 2005, Officer Bryan A. Conroy was convicted at the second of two trials and sentenced to probation. The judge placed the blame for the killing primarily on the poor training and supervision by the Police Department. The city agreed to pay the family $3 million.

Sean Bell Nov. 25, 2006 Five detectives fired 50 times into a car occupied by Mr. Bell, 23, and two others after a confrontation outside a Queens club on Mr. Bell’s wedding day. He was killed. What happened: After a heated seven-week nonjury trial in 2008, the judge found Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper not guilty of all charges, which included manslaughter and assault. In 2012, Detective Isnora was fired, and Detectives Cooper and Oliver, along with a supervisor, were forced to resign. The city agreed to pay the family $3.25 million.

Ramarley Graham Feb. 2, 2012 Mr. Graham, 18, was shot and killed by Richard Haste, a police officer, in the bathroom of his Bronx apartment after being pursued into his home by a team of officers from a plainclothes street narcotics unit. Mr. Graham was unarmed. What happened: A grand jury voted to indict Officer Haste on charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but a judge dismissed the indictment a year later. Prosecutors sought a new indictment. In August 2013, a grand jury decided not to bring charges in the case. The city agreed to pay the family $3.9 million.

Eric Garner July 17, 2014 Mr. Garner, 43, died after Officer Daniel Pantaleo restrained him using a chokehold, a maneuver that was banned by the New York Police Department more than 20 years ago. The officers were trying to arrest Mr. Garner, whose death was attributed in part to the chokehold, on charges of illegally selling cigarettes. What happened: A grand jury, impaneled in September by the Staten Island district attorney, voted not to bring criminal charges against Officer Pantaleo.

She said Mr. Gray “indicated at least twice that he was in need of a medic.” Officer Porter helped Mr. Gray from the floor of the van to the bench, she said, but neither officer belted him in nor requested or rendered medical assistance."

Rough cut (no reporter narration). ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION). Gunfire erupted Sunday night (August 9) in Ferguson, Missouri, as a day of peaceful rallies to mark one year since an unarmed black teen was shot and killed by a white police officer gave way to a confrontation between police and protesters, a Reuters witness said. Video footage shows Interim Police Chief Andre Anderson stop talking during an interview as shots are heard in the background. Anniversary commemorations for Michael Brown had begun with a quiet march through the St. Louis suburb following a moment of silence for the 18-year-old youth. The scene changed dramatically after dark with a crowd of dozens of protesters blocking traffic and smashing store windows along West Florissant Avenue, which bore the brunt of last summer’s rioting, chanting “Shut it down.” The Reuters witness said additional police clad in riot gear roared into the area in heavily armoured vehicles after the shots were heard. A body could be seen on West Florissant Avenue and a young woman screamed that her brother had been shot. Multiple store windows had been smashed out and police stood atop vehicles surveying the scene.

Captured by cellphones or police cameras, footage has spread through social media, shining a light on disturbing police encounters.

“A lot of white people are truly shocked by what these videos depict; I know very few African-Americans who are surprised,” said Paul D. Butler, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former prosecutor.

The videos have led to nationwide protests and federal investigations. And even as policy and attitudes on race shift after footage goes viral, some worry that the constant exposure can desensitize viewers or cause psychological trauma, especially among people of color.

“I know lots of others like myself feel that this is something that really impacts our community, and we have an obligation to see it and understand it and make comments about it,” said Monnica Williams, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who studies racism-related trauma. “But watching it is soul-numbing.”

These videos contain disturbing and graphic scenes of violence. We have compiled them here to provide a record of the raw footage that has sparked a national conversation about race and policing.

Every Saturday my children would go to Cudell for the availability of the wi-fi and the gym and the game room. The snow was just beginning to fall so they would also play outside. They were happy that the snow was here, because would be throwing snowballs already. IT’S BEEN FIVE MONTHS SINCE A ROOKIE POLICE OFFICER IN CLEVELAND FATALLY SHOT 12-YEAR-OLD TAMIR RICE. AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, THE BOY’S FAMILY AND FRIENDS STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR LOSS. SAMARIA - I’m just normal...a single mom from the inner city of Cleveland trying to make a way out. Now I’m out here fighting for justice for my son. Video clip of Devin and Tamir playing in park DEVIN MIMS - I was very close to him. He felt like a little brother to me. 00:06:51 We would swing on the swings, play tag with other friends, run around and just make funny videos. 00:07:03 MIMS - 00:08:42 He was goofy whenever I was around. Things that we always did in the summertime was chase squirrels. And mess with his sister. Devin Mims leaves home, walks toward Cudell park SAMARIA - But the little boy Devin across the street, he usually would knock // knock on the door and asked the kids was they ready to go to the rec. MIMS - 00:19:44 The plan was to meet up at the park. // 00:20:07 And I had the toy gun. Then later on that day when we met up, I gave it to him. MIMS - A while back, it got damaged and wouldn’t shoot BBs anymore, so I removed the tip, the safety tip, so it would shoot again. 911 CALLER 1 - There’s a guy in here with a pistol. You know, it’s probably fake. But he’s like pointing it at everybody. Samaria Rice picks up Tajai from school. Walter Madison driving; SAMARIA - Tamir and Tajai were fairly tall, so people could mistake them at any time. But they were still kids. It doesn’t matter. // They’re kids that play with coloring books and Legos. WHEN THE TIMES VISITED THE RICE FAMILY IN EARLY MARCH, THEY HAD MOVED OUT OF THEIR HOME, LOCATED JUST A BLOCK FROM THE PARK WHERE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED. SAMARIA - Yeah, we don’t want to see that neighborhood like that, for real. Not right now. // A lot of memories. I just was ready to try to start healing a little bit. TAMIR’S MOTHER, SAMARIA, AND HIS OLDER SISTER TAJAI WERE STAYING IN AN EMERGENCY SHELTER. Eating at Stake and Shake... Samaria, “We ain’t got nowhere to chill, y’all, unless you want to go to the library.” THE FAMILY WAS HOMELESS, Walter Madison driving, “this here is police headquarters...” SO THEIR LAWYER WALTER MADISON DROVE US TO THE QUIETEST PLACE WE COULD THINK OF. Walking to Cleveland public library, Jefferson Branch; Walter holds up a book about Cleveland disasters; conversation btwn Samaria and Walter SAMARIA - Is Tamir in that book? It says disasters. The traffic true tales of disaster...oh, ‘tragic’...of destruction... I asked Tajai to go get a book. Tajai struggles with reading... SAMARIA (on camera) - 40:57:13 I talked with Tamir about having toy guns. And I told him there won’t be any in my house b/c people can get the wrong idea. So, I never bought him toy guns, not toy guns, bb guns, water guns, nothing. // Maybe because ... my mom, and what I seen and what my mom put me through and stuff. // My mom went to prison in ‘89. What did she go to prison for? SAMARIA - Manslaughter. She ended up shooting a guy and he died. I was a witness in her trial at the age of 11 years old. So you can imagine what my life has been like. // I made a bad decision in 2012, which made my record not so good. I caught a drug trafficking case. // I’m not sure what I was thinking. SAMARIA - My main thing was to make sure they stayed kids for as long as possible. Cudell rec center surveillance footage 911 CALLER 2 - By the youth center, is a black male sitting on the swings.... SAMARIA - I just know that’s one place they could never get in trouble. I can’t believe the police brought the trouble over there though... 911 CALLER (cont’d) - He keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people. SAMARIA - When you see that video how they sped up so fast, you would think a child would run. My child wasn’t running. He was scared. He was scared, like, what’s going on? Surveillance footage of police shooting OFFICER FRANK GARMBACK (police audio) - Shots fired. Male down. Black male, maybe 20. Black revolver. Black handgun. Send EMS this way, and a roadblock Surveillance footage of officer tackling Tajai in the snow TAJAI RICE - They were like, ah, that’s your brother. So, I ran. I came up. Two police officers tackled me, threw me on the ground, handcuffed me and put me in the car, the same car that shot him. ...I kept on saying, you shot him, my brother is dead. WS Devin Mims MIMS - I was feeling destroyed. How could this happen. He’s only 12 years old. It feels as if I’m the one to blame. But mostly, it’s the officer’s fault. Because he just shot him. Downtown Cleveland, police HQ IN MARCH, THE CITY OF CLEVELAND STATED IN A LEGAL DEFENSE TO THE FAMILY’S LAWSUIT THAT 12-YEAR-OLD TAMIR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN DEATH. Mayor publicly apologizes for insensitive language in the defense MAYOR FRANK G. JACKSON (file footage) - We are apologizing today to the City of Cleveland and to the family... THE PHRASING CAUSED A PUBLIC OUTCRY, AND THE CITY QUICKLY ADJUSTED ITS DEFENSE. MAYOR FRANK G. JACKSON (cont’d) - ...For our poor use of words and our insensitivity... THE NEW LANGUAGE ALSO CASTS BLAME ON DEVIN MIMS, TAMIR’S 16-YEAR-OLD FRIEND, WHO GAVE HIM THE TOY GUN WITH ITS ORANGE SAFETY TIP REMOVED. Tajai and Samaria moving into house IN EARLY APRIL, SAMARIA AND TAJAI RICE MOVED INTO A NEW HOME - STILL IN WEST CLEVELAND BUT FARTHER AT LEAST FROM THE PARK AND THE PAINFUL MEMORIES. Samaria shows Tamir’s pants, SAMARIA - These are Tamir’s pants. I had just bought him these. Yeah, my son was a big boy, but that’s okay. SAMARIA - Me and Tajai did these masks in the shelter with our grief counselor. Samaria flips masks, “And the inside...” SAMARIA - I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to show emotion, but my son never had a chance, and I’m still waiting on answers for why and what happened.

For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them for the applicable NYT Service, see the applicable Cookie Policy here.

We transmit website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for The New York Times when you visit other sites.

If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.

5. Third-Party Advertising

Some of the services and advertisements included in the NYT Services, including on NYTimes.com and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of the NYT Services.

These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our NYT Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the NYT Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.

We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.

For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on the NYT Services, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to NYTimes.com and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

You are not required to purchase anything for certain limited use of NYTimes.com or the NYTimes apps. However, if you do not purchase a subscription or product, your access to NYTimes content and services will be limited.

You can review the various NYTimes digital subscriptions here. We also offer other products and services, such as crosswords, gift subscriptions, e-books and articles from our archive. The purchase of a gift subscription is a one-time purchase; for more information, see the Gift Subscriptions FAQ.

The New York Times reserves the right to modify the content, type and availability of any digital product at any time.

Only one person may use the user name and password associated with a digital product account.

For details about your purchases, including payment methods and billing cycles, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com.

The New York Times will process your purchase as promptly as possible. There may be a delay in the activation of your product while payment details are verified.

We accept major credit cards, PayPal and certain digital wallet services. We reserve the right to reject any order or purchase at any time.

If your initial payment authorization is later revoked, your subscription, product or access will be terminated. Contact our Customer Care group if you believe your access was terminated in error.

When you purchase a digital product, the price will be made clear during the order process. You agree to pay the price that is stated at the time of your order, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency stated at the time of your order.

Discount eligibility is determined at the time of the order. Discounts cannot be applied retroactively.

All prices are in United States Dollars, unless otherwise stated.

The New York Times reserves the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the regular rate of a product changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to accept the new price or cancel your subscription or purchase from that point forward.

Applicable taxes may vary. We are not able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes.

If a stated price is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the product at that price. We will notify you of the error and give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.

Additional Costs

Your subscription may not include access to all areas of the digital product, and you may have to pay additional fees for full access. These additional charges will be clearly stated.

When you use your digital product, you may incur other additional charges from third party service providers, such as telecommunications fees, data fees or service provider fees. You are responsible for paying any additional charges.

If you believe someone else has used your account or you are being charged for a product you do not have, please contact our Customer Care group.

1.5. Billing

1.5.1. Billing of Digital Subscriptions

The currency in which you will be billed will be stated during the purchase process and is determined based on your billing address.

trusted	Why U.S. Weapons Sold to the Saudis Are Hitting Hospitals in Yemen	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006466384/yemen-war-saudi-arabia-usa.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	This is the scene of an airstrike in 2016 in Yemen, on a busy hospital in a small city called Abs. Nineteen people were killed and dozens were injured. The pilot missed clear warning signs and ignored safety measures, like a no-strike list of protected buildings. Found in the debris, the remains of a U.S.-made weapon. America isn’t officially involved here. The fight is between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebel group. But it’s very much a U.S.-supported war. The fighter jets, the bombs, the training and intelligence — much of it is supplied to the Saudis by the U.S. It’s a brutal war. The Houthis have killed hundreds of Yemenis. The Saudi air campaign has been even more lethal. Over four years, coalition airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians and bombed well over 100 medical facilities, a Times assessment found. “If U.S. fighter pilots were doing this directly with U.S. bombs, would there be a change in behavior?” “If we were hitting hospitals, over and over, like what we’re seeing? Absolutely, there would be a change.” Which begs the question: What obligation does the U.S. have when it sells weapons to foreign militaries? U.S. officials claim their ally is doing everything possible to protect civilians. But this is simply not true, according to Larry Lewis, a former State Department official, who saw firsthand how the Saudi coalition failed to protect civilians and how the U.S. chose to look the other way. “Yemen has exposed a fundamental problem in the way we provide arms and the way we support partners. So we need to change the way we do business.” Lewis spent years working with the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan to try to reduce civilian casualties. He wrote a book on protecting civilians that’s issued to every U.S. soldier in Afghanistan. And in 2015, the Obama administration sent him to work with the Saudi coalition in Riyadh. “There were some fundamental problems with how some of the targeting was being done that really needed to be fixed.” During his time there, he reviewed the Abs hospital strike with an investigations team he helped the Saudi coalition to create. “What did you learn from reviewing that airstrike with the Saudis?” “You look at the level of destruction in the nearby buildings and go, the pilot got it way wrong.” Let’s take a look at what happened there. Coalition warplanes attacked a Houthi checkpoint a few miles north of Abs. Medics say that a car transported casualties to the Abs hospital from the strike. The Saudi coalition tracked the car, believing a Houthi leader was inside. For some reason, they didn’t strike it on the open road. Instead, they waited until the car pulled into the hospital. It parked by the emergency room and was hit without warning. Three major failings were evident in the Abs strike, Lewis says, and these were repeated throughout the Saudi-led air campaign. “Doctors Without Borders say that they provided the hospital coordinates to the Saudi coalition.” “That’s right.” “So why did they still hit it?” “That information didn’t get to the cockpit.” The Saudi coalition is often praised by the U.S. for creating a no-strike list, a map of protected sites like schools, refugee camps and hospitals. The list is used to vet targets when airstrikes are preplanned. But that doesn’t happen for the vast majority of strikes, which are on-the-fly bombings or so-called dynamic strikes. “What can be done to limit the number of dynamic strikes, or at least force them to check the no-strike list?” “Mhm. This is not rocket science. It’s not hard to make a requirement for pilots to call back to higher headquarters and say, check the no-strike list and tell me if this object is on the no-strike list, or if there’s something that’s close by. It would take a minute or two.” Another problem? Over and over, Lewis says, pilots seem to ignore large roof signs that identified hospitals, including the one in Abs. We can see six of them in this satellite image taken before the strike. “So the pilot could have seen this marking and recognized, hey, this is a protected facility.” On top of all this, a major issue is a lack of common sense among pilots and spotters on the ground. “You have a pilot that’s not really so experienced, and then you have a person, who’s not even a military person, agreeing on what they think is a valid target, and then engaging that target. So, it’s really fraught with peril.” In Abs, a teacher named Hamza Ahmed Absi saw that peril firsthand. He rushed to the hospital from a nearby school. Muhammad Darm was badly injured in the attack. He’s an X-ray technician, who was helping patients near the hospital’s entrance when the bomb exploded. Muhammad was lucky to survive. He recently returned to work in the hospital. Once a sanctuary in a time of war, he says it no longer feels safe. For years, officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations have said they’re working directly with the Saudis to stem civilian casualties. “I think every Yemeni that is killed — any innocent person is killed — it affects all of us. And there are many steps that are being taken, and have been taken, to try to minimize that.” “The training that we have given them, we know has paid off.” “We are co-located with them in their operation centers to help them develop the techniques and tactics that will allow them to conduct strikes while mitigating civilian casualties.” But one problem with U.S. oversight, Lewis says: The U.S. wasn’t tracking how the American weapons it sold were being used by a Saudi military with little experience in war. In 2018, three years into the conflict, the head of U.S. Central Command said as much. “Is CENTCOM able to tell whether U.S. fuel or U.S. munitions were used as part of that strike?” “Senator, I don’t believe we are.” Lewis says they did have access to that information. They just weren’t using it. “Every flight by the Saudi-led coalition where they were doing airstrikes, that pilot would then make a report that talked about what target was it, what kind of weapons did they use and just information about the strike. They would file it and then that would go to populate this Excel spreadsheet that had every single strike in the campaign.” “And the U.S. and U.K. had access to that database? “They did.” “So if the U.S. wanted to know if American bombs were bombing hospitals, they could have done so?” “Yes.” A year later, after reporters disclosed the database, General Votel changed his tune. “Today, we do have that. We do have a database that does have that information and we have the ability to see that.” Lewis says the database could be a tool to increase U.S. oversight in reviewing foreign weapons sales. A State Department official told us this kind of data could be incorporated into its monitoring, but vetting it can be onerous, and it may be of little use to policymakers. After a Saudi coalition airstrike on a funeral home killed over 150 people in late 2016, the Obama administration, having brokered $100 billion in weapons sales, now sought to distance the U.S. from the coalition. “And their response was, clearly, the Saudis aren’t learning.” It paused sales of precision weapons, and pulled the plug on Lewis’s advising mission. “The U.S. said this is up to the Saudis to do their thing and investigate themselves.” When President Trump took office, the U.S. doubled down on weapons sales. “So we make the best equipment in the world. There’s nobody even close. And Saudi Arabia’s buying a lot of this equipment.” In Yemen, things for civilians continue to get worse. In 2018, the rate of civilian casualties caused by the Saudi-led coalition soared, Lewis says, to almost 50 per week. And in Abs, history repeated itself. Yet another medical facility was attacked in June of that year. The airstrike destroyed a vital cholera treatment center built by Doctors Without Borders to handle the worst outbreak of the disease in modern history. The Saudi coalition tried to shift blame to Doctors Without Borders, saying its buildings weren’t marked. But again, satellite images from before the strike show large red crescents were visible, even from space. And Doctors Without Borders say they shared the center’s coordinates at least 12 times. The Saudis deny this. The U.S. sells weapons to over 100 countries, but in Yemen, the scale of the devastation has become the story. And for the people living there, it’s the new normal.

trusted	How Does Antibody Testing Work? We Went Behind the Scenes to Find Out	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007102893/coronavirus-antibody-testing-process.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	As time goes on, more people are wondering, did I have coronavirus already. “I can help the next patient [INAUDIBLE].“.” Now, Stanford hospitals in northern California are giving their health care workers the answer with antibody testing for all. We were given exclusive access to follow two caregivers and their blood through the antibody testing process. “I do have a loved one at home, my mother, who is high risk. So I want to get tested just to make sure I’m O.K., and kind of maybe surprise her and say, I get to come see you.” First, they’re swabbed to make sure they’re not currently infected. “Oh my god.” And then they give a vial of blood for the antibody test. “There’s so many asymptomatic carriers around, and there’s so many people that may have had it or had mild symptoms, and not had known. If I have the antibodies and someone needs my plasma, I’d love to help out.” “Honestly, I’m hoping that comes back positive, that it’ll teach us a lot.” ”—the blood antibody test for the COVID-19 virus.” This blood test, also known as serology, will show if they had coronavirus in the past, and their immune system raised antibodies to fight it off. But it can’t predict if those antibodies will make them immune. What this and other reliable antibody tests can do is give us a better picture of how widespread coronavirus actually is. And they’re helping researchers design possible treatments and vaccines. “More widespread testing will help us to better understand more quickly what are the important variables, you know, who’s going to be protected, who’s not.” These are samples from the people we just met including, Heidi and Jamshid. Here, they’ll be spun to separate blood cells from plasma. Next, that plasma is taken to a different lab on campus for analysis. “You can see the robot is precisely putting in the right amount of each sample into the wells of the plate.” “There’s been great demand for the test. The lab is basically open 24 hours. The instruments have been running day and night.” Dr. Scott Boyd and his team developed this test, and now they’re ramping up quickly. They’ve just received a new shipment of robots called ELISA Instruments. Soon, the team hopes to process at least 4,000 samples a day. They use controls to validate their tests, so they know it works. The positive controls are from coronavirus patients at Stanford, and the negative are from healthy blood donors, taken before coronavirus jumped to humans. Out of 200 people, the results for a few may be inaccurate. But this kind of test is among the best we have. You can see the controls here in the left column of each assay plate. Once the plate finishes processing, you can see a yellow color in the patient samples that have antibodies. The darker the color, the more antibodies there are. “But just measuring the total quantity doesn’t tell you all the information you’d like to know. The question is, does somebody likely have immunity. The answers are not yet as clear.” Only some antibodies actually fight or neutralize the virus. So the next step for researchers is to identify those ones. Then, how much of those neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus and prevent re infection? “So we’re also now working on developing a neutralizing anybody test that would allow us to test a lot of patients in the hospital, and also health care workers.” That neutralizing antibody test, which Dr. Boyd hopes to have ready by the end of May, will give a better sense of who is actually immune. Remember Heidi from earlier? Well, we watched her sample go through the process. “Coronavirus.” And now her results are in. “Not detected.” All right, so what did the results say? “Negative. Negative COVID and negative serology, unfortunately. But it’s a good thing, right? It can still be good. Today’s really my only safe day, because I go back to work tomorrow. So I feel pretty safe that I can go over, see my mom without a mask. I don’t think she’s got the ability to survive a disease like this, so I’ve had to be very careful. I haven’t seen her face. She hasn’t seen my face without a mask on since like, the beginning of March. I’m negative.” “What?” “Yeah.” “Yay!” “You get to take your mask off, at least for today. Come out here.” “Oh my goodness. I’m so happy.” “I missed you.” “I missed you. Oh, I haven’t had a hug forever. Oh, I’m so happy. O.K. Bye bye, sweetheart. Bye bye.” “All right. Bye bye.” “Thank you.” Jamshid’s results are the same as Heidi’s “So I do not have the antibodies, which is great, because it means PPE works, which is fantastic. I’ve definitely been in multiple rooms with people with known COVID, and I’ve been wearing PPE. And I’m glad that I was at a place that I didn’t have to reuse or recycle my PPE.” Preliminary data is starting to show that Heidi and Jamshid’s negative antibody results are representative. “Hi, Romey.” In places like the Bay Area that haven’t been hard hit, only a small fraction of people are testing positive for antibodies. “You know, where I go to the grocery store, I get it. I go to work again, I get it. It’s out there, so I’m still going to take the same precautions. I’m going to still wear a mask.” But these tests are a first step towards understanding immunity. Just having antibodies is not a free pass. “Hopefully if someone’s positive, it doesn’t give a false sense of security. I still think that everybody needs to protect themselves just the way that we currently are.”	How Does Antibody Testing Work?

I’m Sheri Fink. I’m a correspondent at The New York Times, and I’ve been reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. “Hello.” “Hello.” This is a tiny little office in the intensive care unit. “I just want you to tell us a little bit about her.” And what’s happening in this office right now is that a doctor and a social worker, Dr. Eric Gottesman and social worker Elisa Vicari, they’re connecting on a conference call with the family of a patient. Her name is Carmen Evelia Toro. She is the beloved matriarch of a family that stretches across South America and North America. They don’t have a lot of hope for her to recover from this very severe lung damage that she suffered from the coronavirus. And they want to talk with the family about what to do next. “And it’s not like her lungs have collapsed. They’re just very stiff, kind of like an old sponge that won’t work anymore. We are trying right now a last-ditch effort to give her some high-dose steroids to see if we can get her lungs any less stiff. If they don’t work, there’s nothing else really that we can do to help her.” Because of the coronavirus and the risk of contagion, family members aren’t being allowed in the intensive care unit. And so Elisa Vicari is going into Ms. Toro’s room and then she’s connecting with Ms. Toro’s family so that they can actually see their loved one. And they’re wondering if maybe this is goodbye because they don’t know how long she’ll live. Ms. Toro’s family is scattered across the U.S. and in Colombia. With the pandemic, there’s no way that they can fly to come together and they want to be there for her. The only local family member of Ms. Toro is her granddaughter, Marcela Rendón. It’s Friday evening and she and her husband are at the kitchen table, and they have Ms. Toro’s well-worn Bible next to them. The whole family is connected on the Zoom app. They’re reading Scripture. They’re singing. They’re praying. Ms. Toro is still receiving the steroids, and the family doesn’t know yet whether or not they have worked. It’s Sunday morning, and Marcela and her husband are in the parking lot of the North Shore University Hospital. Unfortunately, news came in that the steroids had not had an effect. The doctors, the medical team are going to remove the ventilator that has been supporting Ms. Toro’s life. “She doesn’t want her to suffer. That’s her concern.” “No, no, she’s not going to — so she’s not going to suffer, and we already gave her some medications already before we take the tube out to make her comfortable.” “Is everybody on Zoom already?” “Yes.” It is the first time that she’s going to get to see her grandma. She dropped her off four weeks ago, and that was the last that she got to see her. She’s there to be with her grandmother. She’s the one who has to take on this responsibility to be the person at the bedside. And as she’s walking into the room, there’s a part of her that knows the likely outcome, and there’s a part of her that has a deep faith that somehow it won’t happen.

And if you notice — 2,000 — we’re not at the peak. But this is where we were just about in late March, when it started to go up. So we’re not at the plateau anymore, but we’re still not in a good position. And the worst news is still tragic news, number of deaths: 540. It’s not as high as it was, still 540 people died yesterday; 504 in hospitals, 36 in nursing homes. Nursing homes are the single biggest fear in all of this. Vulnerable people in one place. It is the feeding frenzy for this virus. The trick with testing is not that we don’t know how to do it. We’ve done it better in this state than almost any other state, almost any other country. It’s bringing this up to scale. We did 500,000 tests in a month. That’s great news. Bad news is, it’s only a fraction of what you need. The more you test, the more information, the more you can reopen society. Look, when we look at this state and we talk about reopening, we’re going to talk about different strategies in different parts of the state. Because the numbers dictate the strategy and you have different numbers in different parts of the state.	‘We’re Not at the Plateau Anymore,’ Cuomo Says of the Outbreak		['The Associated Press']	['talk', 'different', 'nursing', 'anymore', 'plateau', 'cuomo', 'outbreak', 'weve', 'state', 'numbers', 'look', 'homes', 'testing', 'parts']	"So we’re not at the plateau anymore, but we’re still not in a good position.

So what’s your next step?” “Before Covid-19, I would recommend putting you on a breathing machine.” “I would have rushed to intubate.” “Because that was probably the right thing to do.” “I know when to put in a breathing tube. I’ve worked long enough, and I’ve worked enough places with enough people. But in this disease, it is extremely confusing, you know, it just doesn’t make sense. Listen, I stocked up for the apocalypse, like most people. Now, I just can’t believe that I ever thought that I’d somehow be home to make all my frozen food. On a normal day in an I.C.U., you have very sick patients. Patients will — are dying, but this is just different. It’s just — you have a disease we don’t understand that is very deadly with patients that are scared and staff that are scared, and on top of that, it does not appear that we have a good treatment strategy other than a ventilator. And we don’t — we’re not sure when to put a breathing tube in. The crux of it is, we don’t want to put a breathing tube into someone who doesn’t need it knowing that there’s a 70 percent chance they’ll die, and then we don’t want to not put it into someone who would need it too late. When you go to the E.R., and there’s like 40 people that need oxygen, and they all look terrible, but they can all talk to you.” “And no apparent distress whatsoever.” “And then you get them on a monitor, and you look up, and you see this oxygen saturation of 45 percent or 50 percent.” “And telling myself this is impossible. This is not possible. How can this be?” “It’s just not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation that low.” “You know, this is strange. It’s out of a horror movie.” “I’ve been unable to sleep because I’m trying to wrap my head around it. This goes against anything I’ve ever believed.” “The paradigm of ARDS is not matching with the patients that I’m seeing, so it’s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.” “The core of the core of the core — it is just, what disease are we treating? And are we treating something that is naturally ARDS, or are we not?” “We protect the lung against what we do to the lung. Protect it from what? From what we do in mechanical ventilation.” “So what he is saying is that we just have to be gentle. People will need a ventilator, and those that do need as high oxygen as possible, as little pressure as possible, in order to buy time until this demon virus stops.” “These patients have ARDS. I think the editorial has both been misinterpreted, and I think people have misunderstood that it’s just that. It’s an editorial. It’s not a study and it’s not a trial. I don’t doubt that people have seen some cases with some terrifyingly low oxygen numbers. On average, they’re as sick as prior cohorts with ARDS.” “I just think it’s important to say that it’s not a settled question. Every hospital in the world is probably solving its problems slightly differently.” “We’re using an early intubation strategy here, and of our first 66 patients, already a third of them have been extubated. I’m arguing for evidence-based medicine, which is something that we all purported to agree with before this outbreak hit. We have large, randomized, controlled trials. The patients in those trials had met the same diagnostic criteria that our current patients meet. We should apply the results of the trials.” “Today, we do not rush to intubate. Intubate shouldn’t — has become the last resort, and the protocol once they’re intubated has changed drastically.” “So within the last two weeks, I mean, what has been unacceptable has become very acceptable. Some of these patients don’t need to be intubated. You watch them carefully. You make sure their oxygenation is adequate, and they can recover.” “I am not saying we don’t need ventilators, but perhaps we need to think about how we’re using them. Somebody, and preferably people that are not taking care of patients every day, needs to look at the disease and figure out how we can treat it better.” “The truth will come out eventually. In the meantime, the question is: What do we do until that happens? And yes, I’m nervous. I’m scared everyday when I go into work, but I’m just trying to do the best I can.”	‘What Disease Are We Treating?’: Why Coronavirus Is Stumping Many Doctors		['Robin Stein', 'Ainara Tiefenthäler']	['right', 'dont', 'im', 'doctors', 'ive', 'stumping', 'disease', 'oxygen', 'patients', 'know', 'treating', 'think', 'need', 'coronavirus']	"But in this disease, it is extremely confusing, you know, it just doesn’t make sense.

trusted	Low Pay, High Risk: Nursing Home Workers Confront Coronavirus Dilemma	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007046988/nursing-home-coronavirus.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	“You may have just that one patient with the coronavirus that come into your facility, and you don’t know. I can go to work today, wind up feeding them. And then find out two hours later, ‘Oh, they have that virus.’ And I’ve already been exposed. Nursing Assistants, CNA’s, we’re the closest ones, we’re the front line.” The work of nursing assistants has always been difficult and low paying. But add coronavirus, and it’s become dangerous. TV announcers: “Across the country, nursing homes are especially vulnerable —” “One elder care facility, where 19 residents have died —” “In Palo Alto —” “In the New Orleans area —” “In DuPage County —” “In Sacramento County.” “Covid-19 spreading through our most vulnerable population.” We met up with caregivers from nursing homes in Northern California. They attend to the kind of patients who are most likely to die if they get the virus. “So can you do your job without touching people, or without —” “It’s impossible. Everything is touch.” “Bathing. Feeding.” “Assist them to the restroom.” “Brushing their teeth.” “Turning.” “It’s almost like a holding and cleaning at the same time.” “Helping nurses with wound care.” “Cleaning their ears, tying their shoes.” “We do everything.” “Well, you could be feeding that patient or you could be doing something and the patient starts coughing. It’s too late to turn around, you already done got crap all over you. You know, you just run to the bathroom, wash your face or whatever. And then go about your day. Social distance? Can’t do it. It’s impossible.” If this video were filmed at a different time, you’d be seeing footage of these workers with their patients. But nursing homes are closed to visitors right now to protect the people inside. Actually everything you’re seeing here we filmed from afar, following recommendations to slow the spread of Covid-19. But these caregivers can’t maintain that kind of distance in their work. And now, shortages of protective gear like masks are putting them at risk, not just for getting the virus but for spreading it. “If you want to speak, press star 6.” “We’re running out of supplies of masks in our building. And trying to take care of these patients without us also getting sick is worrisome.” “We’re rationing right now, masks, protective gear. But it’s like, what happens if we run out? It scares me.” “They gave us the N95 mask, and told us to maintain it. If the elastic comes off by accident or something, staple and reuse it.” “So you’re actually cleaning the N95 masks in between uses?” “Yeah, with — with alcohol.” “You like wipe off the outside of it or how do you do that?” “The outside, the inside and just let it air dry, and put it back in a Ziploc bag for the next day.” “A lot of people in this field, we have families. So you don’t want to take nothing home. My granddaughter, she’s special needs. So she has a low immune system. When she was born, she was really sick. So we’ve been cautious ever since she’s been born.” “I am very concerned of taking it home. My mom, she’s diabetic, and my dad also just beat cancer in the thyroid. I have asthma. So if I were to get Covid, It would affect my lungs. And how am I going to pay my bills? Because it’s paycheck to paycheck, what I’m doing.” The pay for this work is low: In the U.S., the median salary is less than $30,000 a year. As a result, many nursing assistants work multiple jobs. And as they move between facilities, so can disease. “Usually when I finish the first job, I go right to the second job. I work 16 hours, that’s not including driving time. And I’m not the only one — majority of my co-workers, they work two jobs.” “I work home health care too, on top of taking care of my mom and my grandmother. I’m kind of worried because you don’t see the virus because they’re droplets, and you don’t know who’s coughing or sneezing on you. Even though I do try to sanitize, like along the way, going to my next client. But sometimes it’s just not enough I think. But who else is going to take care of them?”	Low Pay, High Risk: Nursing Home Workers Confront Coronavirus Dilemma		['Emma Cott', 'Ben Laffin', 'Elie Khadra']	['high', 'shes', 'nursing', 'virus', 'pay', 'right', 'care', 'dont', 'patient', 'dilemma', 'confront', 'patients', 'workers', 'risk', 'low', 'masks', 'coronavirus', 'work']	"“You may have just that one patient with the coronavirus that come into your facility, and you don’t know.

Last night, I approved a major disaster declaration for the State of New York. I worked very closely with Governor Cuomo. And this is the first time in our nation’s history that a president has used the Stafford Act to declare a major disaster in response to a public health crisis. Never happened before. I’m considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that. And I’m working very closely with Gavin Newsom, governor of California, and others. We may be doing the same thing depending on their needs, depending on what they’re asking for. There’s been a clear call to action to the private sector and the call is made right here. It’s been really pretty amazing what’s happened with the private sector — they are really in sixth gear, I think — which has responded in full force, helping to produce and supply much needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else. This is a move on that’s incredible right now. And by way of example Hanes — everybody knows Hanes, great company, great consumer cotton products company— is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks. And they’re in that process right now. As you can see over 195,000 people in America have completed their testing. That means tests plus results. This does not count the people whose tests are in process. And as you see this curve is going, it will continue to rise dramatically over the next period of time. Now on a personal note many of you may have been made aware that a member of my staff has tested positive for the coronavirus. We learned of that late yesterday. I am pleased to report that he is doing well. He had mild coldlike symptoms for about a day and a half, has not been to the White House since Monday. Neither the president nor I had direct contact with that staff person. We worked immediately with a White House physician and the C.D.C. We’ve done all contact tracing And, although the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as vice president and as leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon.	‘We’re Working Quickly,’ Trump Says About Coronavirus Relief Efforts		['The Associated Press']	['tested', 'working', 'relief', 'efforts', 'quickly', 'great', 'right', 'trump', 'doing', 'president', 'white', 'worked', 'coronavirus', 'house']	"We’re working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries, and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families.

In my view, I think the right guidance to give all New Yorkers is, even though a decision has not yet been made by the city or by the state, I think New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a ‘shelter in place’ order. It has not happened yet. But it is definitely a possibility at this point. I believe that decision should be made in the next 48 hours. And it’s a very, very difficult decision. I want to emphasize that — it is difficult anywhere in the United States of America. It is particularly difficult in a city with such a large population, so densely populated together. But I think the point has come where that decision does have to be made. We will be communicating closely with the state. Obviously, it’s a decision we want to make in common. And I think it’s just right to let people know that there is that possibility. As of this hour, the number of confirmed cases in New York City is 814. The sad reality of the prediction I made last week that we would hit 1,000 cases this week is obviously about to come true. And I’m very sorry to say that. The borough breakdown as of this point: 248 cases in Queens, 277 cases in Manhattan, 157 cases in Brooklyn, 96 cases in the Bronx and 36 cases in Staten Island. Again, very sorry to say we have lost seven of our fellow New Yorkers to coronavirus.	‘Shelter in Place’ Order Possible, de Blasio Says		[]	['week', 'difficult', 'place', 'right', 'possibility', 'blasio', 'city', 'yorkers', 'order', 'decision', 'think', 'cases', 'point', 'shelter', 'possible']	"And it’s a very, very difficult decision.

trusted	Super Tuesday Is Over. What Just Happened?	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000006970753/super-tuesday-results.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	This was a night that was supposed to bring clarity to the Democratic race … “Hello, hello, hello, hello!” “Here’s what is clear.” “I don’t know what’s going to happen later tonight.” … and establish whether there was one clear front-runner or maybe two clear front-runners, or no front-runners at all. We’ve covered contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. “Can I get you to wear a button?” “I’m with the press.” “Sure I know, I’m just trying.” And now we’ve arrived at Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday is the single most important date on the primary calendar. You have more than a dozen states and territories voting at the same time. And it is the first real test of which candidates are drawing broad national appeal. “Winston-Salem, thank you!” “Hello, Denver!” “Tennessee will deliver. This is the Volunteer State.” The biggest prizes on the map are Texas and California. But all told, you’re looking at about a third of all the delegates that are at stake in the Democratic primary are at stake on Super Tuesday. This was a good night, especially for Joe Biden. “It’s a good night! It’s a good night!” We have seen that Biden has been regaining traction in the race over the last couple of days. “It ain’t over, man. We’re just getting started.” But he pulled off a series of big wins and upsets in places where even a newly revived Biden campaign wasn’t terribly optimistic about winning. Over the last few days, we have seen an extraordinary coalescing of support around Joe Biden. “I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden!” When he collected those endorsements on Monday from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, that only accelerated his new momentum. So many of Joe Biden’s most important and biggest victories on Super Tuesday came in states where black voters make up either a majority or a very, very large share of the primary electorate. “We just got in from Alabama. We won Alabama!” Joe Biden edged out a narrow victory in Texas, but it was a close outcome. And Bernie Sanders recorded very significant support, especially from Latino voters and progressives. This was a solid night for Bernie Sanders. This was not some massive setback. It was not the massive breakthrough that his campaign hoped it would be. But what we did see him do, was continue adding significantly to his delegate count in a series of states where his progressive base was strong. “Hi, my name is Tom. I’m from the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.” Most importantly, California. In his speech on election night … “This will become a contrast in ideas.” … Bernie Sanders made it pretty clear that in the coming weeks he is going to be going after Joe Biden even more aggressively. “One of us in this race led the opposition to the war in Iraq — you’re looking at him.” It was not such a good night for Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. Warren has needed to make a comeback, and she did not carry a single state. She even came in third in her home state of Massachusetts. This was the first time that Michael Bloomberg’s name appeared on a ballot in this Democratic primary. He spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, and other campaign operations in the Super Tuesday states. In the end, he only won a single contest in American Samoa. Ultimately, Bloomberg and Warren both dropped out. For the first time in this campaign, you really have the two wings of the Democratic Party organized under a pair of clear front-runners. Joe Biden, closer to the political center … “Look, most Americans don’t want the promise of a revolution. They want results. They want a revival of decency, honor and character.” … and Bernie Sanders, further to the left. “From day one, we have been taking on the establishment. It is no surprise, they do not want me to become president.” There is clearly a real hunger among many voters in the party to coalesce quickly around someone they see as an electable challenger for President Trump. Do you want some kind of salutation or — Producer: “No, no.” It’s only March, and we’ve got a long way to Election Day. The Times will continue covering the campaign from all angles, from the campaign trail to investigations to analysis and beyond. For our latest reporting, go to nytimes.com/2020. Thanks for watching.

Captured by cellphones or police cameras, footage has spread through social media, shining a light on disturbing police encounters.

“A lot of white people are truly shocked by what these videos depict; I know very few African-Americans who are surprised,” said Paul D. Butler, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former prosecutor.

The videos have led to nationwide protests and federal investigations. And even as policy and attitudes on race shift after footage goes viral, some worry that the constant exposure can desensitize viewers or cause psychological trauma, especially among people of color.

“I know lots of others like myself feel that this is something that really impacts our community, and we have an obligation to see it and understand it and make comments about it,” said Monnica Williams, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who studies racism-related trauma. “But watching it is soul-numbing.”

These videos contain disturbing and graphic scenes of violence. We have compiled them here to provide a record of the raw footage that has sparked a national conversation about race and policing.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

archived recording Hello? Hello?

michael barbaro

Today, the death of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery and my colleague Richard Fausset’s investigation into it. It’s Monday, May 11. Richard, how did you first hear about this story?

richard fausset

I learned about this story in early April. I was up to my eyeballs in coronavirus coverage, along with my other colleagues in the national desk. And on April 2, my colleague Kim Severson, a food writer for The Times here in Atlanta, and a dear friend of mine, sent me a very brief note. And it said, “Look, you are busy. But this one’s looking pretty troubling.” She included a link to a story in The Brunswick News down in Brunswick, Georgia. And it looked to be a story of two armed white men, who were chasing an unarmed black man by the name of a Ahmaud Arbery through their neighborhood, and that that chase ended with a confrontation and with the black man being killed. The local coverage also showed that one of the men who was involved in this chase was a former police officer on the county police force, who had also spent years as an investigator in the district attorney’s office. And although the shooting had occurred on February 23, here we are in April, and no one had been arrested for it. It was very disturbing. And it seemed like there were a lot of unanswered questions. And I really didn’t know if I could answer them. But I had to set it aside for a while, just because we had this avalanche of news rolling in. So 10 or 11 days after getting this initial email from Kim, I started filing a flurry of open records requests. And I had a sense of what I was pretty sure I could get from this from covering previous controversial shootings in Georgia. I knew that I should be able to get a copy of the incident report, which is this brief summary that police file of what they saw when they arrived at the scene. I was pretty sure I could get the 911 call recordings, which I don’t think anybody had asked for yet. And then there was this other really just last-minute request that I filed. And I filed it with the county. And it was really just kind of a fishing expedition that I filed that turned out to be the most important public records request. And in that request, I asked for all of the emails to and from public officials from the day of the shooting up to mid-April.

michael barbaro

So essentially, you were trying to figure out if people in power in this community in the hours after this shooting are doing what you might expect them to do, which is saying oh, my god. Did you hear about this? What do we do? What do you think? That kind of thing.

richard fausset

Yeah. I thought maybe there would just be some chatter. They might have just been gossiping. You know, there just might have been a kind of, “oh, my god” kinds of emails. I didn’t quite know what to expect. But I think that was my first thought. So under Georgia law, all of those entities have three days to respond to my request. And of course, in an ongoing homicide investigation, there are a lot of things they can say that they’re not going to give me. So I talked to my editor, and we decided that I would wake up super early, drive down to Glynn County, Georgia — which is about four and a half or five hours from my home base in Atlanta — to a neighborhood called Satilla Shores, and do some social-distancing reporting. Satilla Shores is a middle-class neighborhood — you know, ranch houses and a few nicer homes that look like retirement homes. It’s kind of out of the way. There’s moss hanging from the oaks. I mean, it’s dramatically beautiful. And it kind of evokes Faulkner — I mean, Faulkner with ranch houses. And Satilla Shores is in the unincorporated part of Glynn County. Glynn County is a majority white place. It’s about 27 percent black. And like almost every part of the south, it has a very tragic and awful racial history, a history of lynchings of black men in the late 19th century. So I pulled up and parked my car near the McMichaels’ home. This is the home of the two men who chased Ahmaud. And almost as soon as I parked, a woman came out. And she started asking me what I was doing there. And I told her. She told me she’d called the police on me. And she told me she was armed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

You know, I think there was just a lot of tension in the neighborhood. And people were suspicious of my presence there. One very angry woman drove up to me as I was just walking the street and asked me repeatedly what I was doing there in a pretty hostile way. I came across another couple, and they had already made up their mind that Ahmaud Arbery deserved what he had gotten.

michael barbaro

Wow.

richard fausset

So on Thursday night, I drove back to Atlanta. And on Friday morning, I received the response to this last public records request that I had filed. And Michael, as you know, a lot of times, those kinds of public records requests just bring back just a bunch of dross, you know, just garbage.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

richard fausset

But in this case, when I opened this fat email attachment, I knew immediately that I had found something pretty explosive.

michael barbaro

What was that?

richard fausset

So the first document in this file was a three-page memo written by a district attorney in Waycross, Georgia named George Barnhill, who at the time was the prosecutor in the case. And the prosecutor in a case like this often advises the local police as to whether or not there’s sufficient probable cause to go to a judge and ask for an arrest warrant. Mr. Barnhill, in this letter, laid out an extensive justification — legal justification — for why he believed there was not sufficient probable cause to issue any arrest warrants for anyone. And his argument was that Mr. Arbery had committed a burglary, and that the men who pursued him were justified in pursuing him under Georgia’s Citizen Arrest law. It said that the man who shot Ahmaud Arbery, Travis McMichael, was justified in doing so because Mr. Arbery had grabbed the shotgun. He had initiated the fight. And Travis McMichael was allowed to use deadly force to protect himself under Georgia’s Use-of-Force statute. And it said, of course, that the men were legally armed under Georgia’s open-carry law. But there were a lot of pieces of this that I knew a lot of lawyers and even other prosecutors were very likely going to take issue with.

michael barbaro

So in this prosecutor’s telling, everything that these two men did in this interaction that resulted in Arbery’s death, despite the fact that he was unarmed, was completely legal. They were allowed to carry the guns. They were allowed to make a citizen’s arrest. They were allowed, in his telling, to defend themselves from this unarmed man.

richard fausset

In Mr. Barnhill’s words, it was his conclusion there was insufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants at the time.

michael barbaro

And in your mind, what makes this so explosive?

richard fausset

I mean, what’s explosive here is that you have this well-detailed legal justification for an action that I knew many people would see as one that just violates their basic sense of what’s right. You had two armed white men in a truck chasing after an unarmed black man in a suburb in the deep south. There’s a confrontation. The black man is shot and killed. And no one has been arrested. And there’s an argument now, a legal argument, that no one should be arrested.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

richard fausset

So I reported my story about this case. And I included this information about this district attorney, who gave this legal justification for why no one should be arrested. It also included the fact that, by that point, that district attorney had recused himself for a conflict of interest. It turns out that his son worked in the local district attorney’s office with Greg McMichael, one of the men who had pursued Ahmaud Arbery. And the reaction to this story was pretty strong. But we were also in the midst of a pandemic. And we were social distancing. And the country was locked down. And so the kinds of protests that we’ve seen crop up in big cities and in other places when issues like this come to light were not materializing.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And so it was sort of unclear, really, where this whole drama was headed. But then on Tuesday, a video emerged online. It was a 36-second video. And it showed the last violent moments of Ahmaud Arbery’s life. And that started to change everything.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Richard, what exactly does this video show?

richard fausset

The video appears to be shot from a moving car. And it shows a man running, presumably Ahmaud Arbery. He’s approaching a white pickup truck. There’s a man in the bed of the truck — Greg McMichael. And there’s a man standing outside the truck with a shotgun — his son Travis. Mr. Arbery jogs to the right, presumably in an effort to just get away from Travis McMichael. But they tangle, and it’s violent. And you can see the shotgun between them. There’s a shotgun blast and more fighting. They go offscreen for a moment. There’s a second shotgun blast and more fighting. And then there’s a third shot. And you can see Mr. Arbery turn as if to run further. But then you see him crumple and fall to the pavement.

michael barbaro

Richard, what do we know about where this video came from and who shot it?

richard fausset

The video was shot by a third man who was also engaged in the pursuit of Ahmaud Arbery.

michael barbaro

So another man in the neighborhood, who was essentially chasing him?

richard fausset

Right.

michael barbaro

And how does this video and all those details you just described change our understanding of this event?

richard fausset

Well, it appears there’s some contradiction in the initial story that Greg McMichael laid out in the initial police report. In it, Mr. McMichael said that he and his son pulled up beside Ahmaud Arbery. And they shouted “stop,” and they’d been shouting it before. And it was at that moment that Travis McMichael gets out of the truck with his shotgun. But the video shows that they were actually waiting for him in the truck. He was being blocked in because you had a third man, the man with the cell phone video, who was chasing him.

michael barbaro

So it very much shows him being trapped by these pursuers.

richard fausset

Yeah, it looks like he’s trapped.

archived recording The shooting took place back in February. And at the time, it remained a largely local story. But all that changed yesterday. Some video of the shooting went viral on the internet.

richard fausset

I mean, it’s one thing to read about a man struggling for his life and being shot and killed. And I think, just emotionally, it’s just a totally different story when you see it.

archived recording (stacey abrams) I believe that there should be immediate investigation of charges. It looks like murder.

richard fausset

Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial Democratic candidate in Georgia, spoke out about it in an interview. LeBron James, the basketball star, tweeted about it.

archived recording “We’re literally hunted every day, every time we step foot outside the comfort of our homes,” he said.

richard fausset

Joe Biden spoke about it in an interview.

archived recording (joe biden) Well, it sure looks like murder to me. At a minimum, it needs a thorough investigation. archived recording (brian kemp) Earlier this week, I watched a video depicting Mr. Arbery’s last moments alive.

richard fausset

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican who has created a lot of ill will among people of color, particularly in Georgia, for a very divisive campaign, talked about the need for Georgians to find justice in this case.

archived recording (brian kemp) I can tell you it’s absolutely horrific. And Georgians deserve answers.

michael barbaro

So just looking at this video, it seems pretty uncomplicated what’s going on here.

richard fausset

It’s not entirely uncomplicated. There’s another video that’s emerged. And this one appears to be a surveillance video from a house on the block. And it shows a man who appears to be Mr. Arbery going inside of a house that’s under construction near the McMichaels’ house. It’s sort of unclear what he’s doing there. And his family’s lawyer has said that, yes, he stopped by a house, by a property that was under construction while he was jogging. But still, the idea of an unarmed man out for a jog being chased down and killed by armed civilians, no matter what he was doing in the midst of the jog, is really what’s resonated so widely. And in fact, it’s become very much a rallying cry.

archived recording I’m running for Ahmaud today. He’s the young man that was gunned down in Georgia while jogging.

richard fausset

People were going out and jogging in solidarity with Ahmaud. They were using the hashtag, “I run with Ahmaud.”

archived recording 1 This morning’s run, 2.23 miles. I run with Ahmaud, baby. archived recording 2 I run with Ahmaud. archived recording 3 2.23 — we with you, young king. archived recording 4 2.23 for Ahmaud. Let’s go. I haven’t run in 10 years, but I’m doing it.

richard fausset

They’re running 2.23 miles as a way of noting the day that he was killed: February 23.

archived recording (protestors) No justice, no peace. No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

And then late last week —

archived recording (protestors) No justice! No peace!

richard fausset

— hundreds of protesters gathered in the streets of Glynn County, Georgia in masks and gloves.

archived recording This is about corruption and cover-up by the Glynn County Police Department.

richard fausset

It felt like the ball was rolling downhill and gathering force every moment.

archived recording (protestors) This is not a murder. This was an assassination.

michael barbaro

At this point, Richard, how are people thinking about this case? And how is that differing from the way that it was first described in that memo that you unearthed with your public records request?

richard fausset

So I think what you saw from this mass protest was a fundamental disagreement with the legal analysis in this document that I dug up. People were calling this a lynching. They were evoking the context of the southern past and the American present. They just thought it was wrong.

michael barbaro

And at this point, as these protests are mounting, what is the status of the legal case?

richard fausset

Well, a lot starts happening. In my original reporting on this case, I noted that the D.A., George Barnhill, had recused himself. And there was a new prosecutor. As just the interest in this case exploded last week, he announced that he thought that the case should be presented to a grand jury in Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges being brought against the men involved in Mr. Arbery’s death.

michael barbaro

So that’s a very big change from the last prosecutor on the case.

richard fausset

Right. This is a total 180. He also invited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to get involved. And the bureau launched its own independent investigation. And by Thursday night, Greg McMichael and his son had been arrested and charged with murder.

[music]

michael barbaro

What’s fascinating about that is that the video seems to describe what had been laid out in your reporting and in these legal documents beforehand. Right? There’s not a giant gap between them.

richard fausset

Yeah. I think what this video did is it really moved this case from the local stage to a global stage. And although we can’t know, for now at least, what the reasoning of this new district attorney was for saying the case needs to go before a grand jury, for indeed arresting these men, there’s no question that he’s now making decisions in a universe where many more people are paying very close attention.

michael barbaro

Right. It was no longer a local prosecutor writing a memo explaining why no one should be prosecuted, knowing that no one was paying all that much attention.

richard fausset

Right. For me, it was just a very surreal moment because I’m thinking back to that moment, which is a very private one. I’m in my house. The country is locked down. This email comes. And it has this very controversial legal opinion from a very obscure prosecutor.

michael barbaro

Right.

richard fausset

And I felt like one person in on a conversation in a very closed and constrained system. And now, it seems like this whole story has just been blown out into the open.

michael barbaro

So Richard, where does this case stand right now?

richard fausset

So the McMichaels are currently in a jail in Glynn County. They haven’t had a chance to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. But the pandemic is still playing a role here. The Georgia court system has declared that a grand jury can’t be impaneled due to the coronavirus until after June 12, and that that stay could be extended at the discretion of the chief justice of the State Supreme Court if the pandemic continues to linger.

michael barbaro

What has been the response from Ahmaud Arbery’s family?

richard fausset

Ahmaud’s mother, Wanda Cooper, has maintained from the beginning that she believes her son, who was known to stay in good shape, was simply out for a jog. And I think there is some sense of relief that arrests have finally been made in this case after so many weeks of waiting. But I think they know that they’re only at the beginning of a new stage in this case and it could take a very long time to see it to its end.

[music]

michael barbaro

Richard, what do you make of this case that you have now been working on for about a month or more?

richard fausset

Well, it’s hard not to talk about this case without talking about the historical context of extrajudicial killings of people of color in the south and in the whole country. And I think a lot of people were shocked and dismayed by the details of this case. But they weren’t necessarily shocked that it happened. And I think one of the things that we’re starting to sketch out here are the systems in place, things like Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law, that might allow for the perpetuation of these kinds of problems. And I think even though we’re all looking closely at these systems, no one’s sure whether this story, as tragic as it is, may in the end serve to change them.

michael barbaro

Richard, thank you very much.

richard fausset

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Friday, a lawyer representing Ahmaud Arbery’s family called for a civil rights investigation, focused not only on the men who pursued and shot him, but the broader justice system that took weeks to prosecute them. On Sunday night, Georgia’s attorney general asked the federal government to conduct a similar investigation.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

The Trump Administration is trying to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus inside the White House after an aide to Vice President Mike Pence and a valet to President Trump tested positive. That has prompted at least three top officials leading the government’s response to the pandemic, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, to begin two weeks of self-quarantine.

So I cover immigration in and around New York City, and over the past few months, like everybody, I’ve been covering the coronavirus crisis. And not too long ago, I started looking at how that experience has been different for Latino immigrant families.

One thing I noticed pretty much right away is that hundreds and hundreds of families were turning to GoFundMe, to the crowd funding site. And they were setting up pages to pay for funerals and hospital bills and also to send their relatives’ remains back to their home countries, to maybe mothers or grandmothers. So I started just sending emails to the people who had created these sites, and one of the first responses I got was from a girl in New Jersey and her twin sister. I got a very polite text saying that they were willing to speak, so I gave them a call. And quickly, I learned that their story was just wrenching.

annie correal All right. Hi there, Melanie. How are you? melanie cruz morales Hi. I’m OK. I’m taking every day by day. How are you today? annie correal I’m fine. Thank you.

annie correal

So Sheila and Melanie Cruz Morales, they’re identical twins. They live in Teaneck, N.J., which is a suburb of New York City.

annie correal And tell me a little bit about yourself. How old are you? melanie cruz morales So I am 19 years old. I am a political science major at Bergen Community College. I’m from a Mexican immigrant family, and I am a DACA recipient. Those are a couple things about me.

annie correal

They’re really obviously studious, dedicated, driven young women. And they have a kind of passion for politics that they say they’ve discovered in their early teenage years.

melanie cruz morales Yeah, and we’re both going to transfer somewhere else this fall. annie correal I overheard Sheila in the background. Do you want to — hi, Sheila. sheila cruz morales Hi. Sorry. annie correal That’s OK. Nice to meet you. sheila cruz morales Yeah, it’s nice to meet you.

annie correal

So Sheila, she’s kind of the shy one of the two.

sheila cruz morales I’m usually very quiet and I just let Melanie do the talking.

annie correal

So it’s Melanie, her sister, who tells me the entire story of their uncle Javier. She just lost him to Covid-19.

[music]

michael barbaro

And who is her uncle, Javier?

annie correal

So her uncle Javier, Javier Morales, is the kind of father figure for her whole family.

melanie cruz morales Basically the way we migrated over here to this country really started with my uncle Javier, who he was one of the first ones who planted seeds in this country.

annie correal

You know, he speaks English. He’s more integrated.

melanie cruz morales He basically taught us a lot and prepared us for what life would be like here.

annie correal

And he’s come a long way because he and his family come from this little tiny village of 200 people and shrinking in Oaxaca. It’s called Santa Catarina Yosonotú.

michael barbaro

And what’s this village like in Oaxaca?

melanie cruz morales It’s literally a small town in the midst of mountains everywhere.

annie correal

So Santa Catarina Yosonotú is indigenous. Many people only speak a language called Mixtec.

melanie cruz morales I think one of the smells that always, always brings me back to it is the scent of fire and wood burning.

annie correal

Because people cook the tortillas over wood fires.

melanie cruz morales You know, there’s no stove. There’s not really much electricity.

annie correal

It’s like lost to time.

melanie cruz morales And there’s not much technology. The way that we call my grandmother who lives in a pueblo is by calling the station where they have phones.

annie correal

There’s just a central call center.

melanie cruz morales Because no one else has phones there.

annie correal

Where someone comes onto the loudspeaker and announces.

melanie cruz morales “It’s Lourdes. I’m calling for Señora Francesa.” And then it’s just funny because my mom is, like, on the phone for five minutes waiting for Grandma to rush down to the center and pick up the phone call.

michael barbaro

So this town is small enough that when an announcement is made over some loudspeaker, everyone in town can hear it.

annie correal

That’s right.

melanie cruz morales It’s a very small town.

annie correal

So in this village, there’s one little grocery store that everyone goes to. This is where you’d go for your beans and rice and Coca-Cola. And this is where uncle Javier worked when he was young, along with his seven siblings. It was the family business.

melanie cruz morales Because everybody would come to the store to buy things, and that’s how everyone knows my family back home.

annie correal

But when Javier was about 18, his father died tragically, and that’s why he left and went to the United States to begin supporting his rather large family.

[music]

michael barbaro

So where in the U.S. did he go?

annie correal

He goes first to California, and he works in the fields. He works as an agricultural worker and eventually travels over to Florida before going up to Teaneck, N.J. And there he found a job for a trucking company, called Cort. He starts driving — they supply furniture for big events like the Super Bowl one year and conventions at the Javits Center in New York City. And so he gets to know the whole country as he makes these trips. And in the process, he seems to sort of fall in love with the United States. He finds an apartment building, and he slowly starts telling his relatives, there’s a lot of opportunity here. Why don’t you come? So slowly, some cousins come over, more and more people, his best friend. Javier’s baby brother, Martin, comes over when he’s about 18, and they move into the apartment complex that he’s found for them. And eventually, the twins, Melanie and Sheila, come over with their mother when they’re about four years old.

melanie cruz morales Just like a lot of other migrants, we crossed the border.

annie correal

They walk across the desert from Mexico into Arizona and travel by car to New Jersey.

melanie cruz morales It’s funny because I vividly remember coming off Route 80.

annie correal

Even though they were so little, Melanie remembered pulling off Route 80 and driving up to what would become her new home, this apartment complex in this unfamiliar new country, and the first person she sees is her uncle Javier, who greets them with open arms.

melanie cruz morales And that’s the first time I really got to meet my cousin and uncle. So they were already here. They were just waiting for us. annie correal So you created like a little second village in Teaneck, N.J.? melanie cruz morales Yeah, we really did. We all realized that this is where we would all be able to have a better life, and little by little over time, we have made it our home. Yeah.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what is this new home, this apartment complex in Teaneck, N.J., like?

annie correal

So they really come to love this building.

melanie cruz morales So our apartment building, that we’ve lived in for 15 years, is three stories. And outside of it is brick, so it stands really strong, and it’s up on a hill. And in the back of the apartment building, there’s this really, really, really big parking lot.

annie correal

There’s a big parking lot outside where they grill meat and sit around on Sundays. The men sit around on their one day off per week, and they listen to music and have a couple of beers, and no one minds because everyone’s family.

melanie cruz morales And the parking lot is where everyone would see each other at least once a day, and we would stop and smile and wave at each other, catch up. And it was also where all the little kids who lived in the apartment building would come out to play.

annie correal

You walk inside, and there’s a central staircase.

melanie cruz morales Which leads you to the second floor, and that is where my uncle Javier used to live. On the third floor is my apartment, and then directly across is where my cousin Kobe and his two little siblings and my aunt and my uncle Martin also lived.

annie correal

Everyone calls each other tío and tía.

melanie cruz morales I said hi, tío, and he said hi.

annie correal

Uncle and aunt.

melanie cruz morales Our apartment had always the doors open because we all knew each other.

annie correal

They go back and forth between each other’s apartments. The doors are unlocked. You know, they’re constantly passing each other in the stairwells, knocking on the door and asking for salsa or soda.

melanie cruz morales We always knew that my uncle Javier always had soda stocked up. So we would go rushing down to his apartment building and tell him, “Hey, do you want to come up and have dinner with us? And bring soda.” And he would always come upstairs with anything that we needed.

michael barbaro

Sounds pretty idyllic.

annie correal

Yeah, I mean, it’s really been home.

melanie cruz morales A lot of people say that when you rent an apartment, it’s always very temporary, and you don’t really feel at home, but that place, for some reason, always, always felt like a forever type of situation. Sometimes in the night when I would be speaking to my sister and my brother, we’d all come around. And I told them, one day when we have money, and we have our careers, and we’re grown, I would like to come back to this place. And I would like to purchase a building with you, with my sister, with my brother, and have it as a place for the family because it was that special to us.

michael barbaro

And what was Melanie and her sister’s relationship like with their uncle Javier?

annie correal

So I think they had a special bond with their uncle Javier. In some ways, he recognizes a lot of promise in them. When he became a US citizen, he actually asked Melanie to sit down with him, and they made flashcards so he could study for his citizenship exam.

melanie cruz morales I would ask him, who was the first president of the United States? And he would tell me the answer, and I guess that was one of the times where we really bonded.

annie correal

And she remembered that as a kind of funny role reversal because she was 9, 10 years old, and there she was trying to teach her uncle who the country’s first president was.

melanie cruz morales It was a bunch of him just getting the wrong answers or him getting the right answers and me being so surprised by it.

annie correal

He really believed in them and thought that they were on a path to success. They were trying to transfer to a four-year college, and he was constantly checking in with them and asking them where they wanted to go and what they wanted to be. At some point, he delivers furniture to Yale University, and he sees the Gothic campus and the beautiful old buildings, and it makes an impression. He comes back, and he tells the twins, “That’s the kind of place where you should go.”

melanie cruz morales He came back and he showed me, “Look, this is the school.” He showed so many pictures. He was like, “I really liked it. I hope that one day that you can go to a school like this.”

annie correal

He’s a real believer in the American dream, and he passes that on to his nieces.

[music]

So he passes the test, and he obtains citizenship status. And that means a lot of things. I mean, for him, it means he can travel back to his village and see his mother. And having a citizen in the family is so important. There are things you never think of.

melanie cruz morales I felt in a way safer to know that I had an uncle who was a citizen, you know, simple little things like me hopping into his car and him driving. And me knowing that he had a license meant the world to me just because of how on edge you are as an undocumented person.

annie correal

And because he’s legally on the books working for this trucking company, he has a salary, he has vacation time, he has paid sick leave.

michael barbaro

And these are things that many of the people living in that apartment complex, many of his relatives don’t have.

annie correal

Exactly. I mean, at the time, none of them, no one had citizenship. So he’s only 48, but he has really become kind of the central figure of the family. He’s also really the heart of the family.

archived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales (LAUGHS) It’s so funny. He liked a lot of Mexican bands, corridos, a lot of banda. He was so proud of it, and he loved to show it off, and it’s like a little joke in our family. archived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales I’ll never forget, I think it was his birthday three years ago or two years ago, and there’s this one song that you sing when you’re heartbroken, when you just got like broken up with. And we had, like, the microphone, and like, everyone in the tiny little apartment was enjoying it, had a good time, and it was literally like being in a little concert. But everyone was so into it, like even the little kids, even the teenagers, like my cousin, sometimes we think they we’re too cool for our culture, that we’re too Americanized, but in that moment, everyone was just enjoying it. And it was just really, really nice, because he was so happy, and everyone was really happy.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Annie, what happens to this family over the past few months?

annie correal

So this year, Javier goes on his annual trip to Mexico in early March to see his mother, and he comes back and goes straight back to work at the trucking company. And not long after, he starts to feel sick. And you know, he thinks it’s just a cold, but he’s watching the news and all these reports about the coronavirus, and he decides to self-quarantine. Again, you know, he has a job that offers him paid sick leave. So he stops working, and you know, he’s pretty sure it’s nothing to worry about, but it’s better to be safe, and it doesn’t go away.

[music]

So he goes to the closest hospital, to Teaneck. He describes his symptoms. He tells them what kind of work he does and that he’s just traveled, and he asks to take a test, and he’s turned away. He’s told he probably has the flu, and he should rest, take some medicine, and he’ll get better. So he goes home, and the next day he wakes up, and he’s still sick. In fact, he’s even sicker than the day before. And he starts to get a little frightened, so he goes to another doctor, and they tell him the same thing. So it’s now been two attempts, and his symptoms are getting worse. So he does hear that there’s a new testing site in New Jersey at a community college, but he goes on a day when they’re only testing first responders, like doctors and nurses, and he didn’t know that. So they turned them away. And at that point, he’s really scared.

melanie cruz morales So he had no other option but to go to another hospital in Hackensack.

annie correal

So he drives to the hospital in Hackensack, N.J., that same day, and he goes straight to the E.R., and finally, he gets admitted.

melanie cruz morales He went there, and he basically told my aunt he, told them, “Oh, I’m here, I’m OK, don’t worry, and I’ll call you back later.” And that was last time my aunt was ever able to speak to him.

michael barbaro

So this is his fourth attempt to get a test.

annie correal

That’s right, and it’s on this visit where he finally gets tested, and he tests positive for Covid-19.

melanie cruz morales They realized that he was in critical condition, so they moved him up to the I.C.U. and immediately put him on a ventilator. And all the events really happened so fast, nobody could have thought that he would have contracted the virus. We see it on the news, and we see what’s going on, but it doesn’t hit you until it hits home. And then that’s when the reality starts to settle in.

annie correal

The whole family is just worried to death. Then, a few days later, Javier’s baby brother, Martin, starts to feel a little sick himself.

melanie cruz morales When I found out that my uncle, who lived right across from me, was sick, I really couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a joke. Like, I thought there’s no way that two family members could possibly have this virus. And so I called my little cousin Kobe, and I told him, “What’s going on, is your dad OK?” And he said, “Yes, he’s fine. He’s just showing flu-like symptoms.”

annie correal

The thing is, he’s younger than Javier. He’s 39. He cycles every day. He loves riding his bike to the George Washington Bridge. He keeps in really good shape. And so when he gets sick, no one is really all that worried. And he decides that after having seen everything that his brother went through, he’s not going to jump through those hoops. He, unlike his brother, is undocumented. So he thinks, if that was what my brother went through, what’s it going to be like for me?

michael barbaro

So he thinks, since I’m undocumented, what would be my chances of ever getting tested or treated efficiently, so he just basically does nothing.

annie correal

Exactly. So he goes into isolation in a room in his apartment, in this complex, where the whole family lives.

melanie cruz morales My dad rushed over and made a huge pot of home remedies. He made tea. He made onion, garlic, ginger, a bunch of things mixed together, and he packaged it up and dropped it off right in front of his door, of my uncle Martin’s door. And he gave it to him, and that’s basically all that my uncle was taking, because I don’t think he understood this virus. I don’t think anybody did and especially not us.

annie correal

So meanwhile, Uncle Javier is still in the Hackensack hospital. His family is getting regular reports, even some reports that he’s stable.

melanie cruz morales He had been in the I.C.U. for seven days, a week total. And on the last day, we got the phone call.

annie correal

On Monday, April 6, they learned that uncle Javier has died. His heart has stopped.

[music]

So the night after Javier has died, the twins and their big brother, they’re having dinner, and they go and they get some tequila, and they’re about to raise a glass to their uncle Javier.

melanie cruz morales We were in our living room playing Mexican music. And we had — my brother opened a bottle of Patron because my uncle Javier had just passed away, and we wanted to take a shot of tequila and honor him because it was his favorite drink.

annie correal

When they hear someone banging on the door. And they go to the door without opening it, and it’s their cousin Kobe. It’s Martin’s son. He’s 16, and he’s shouting for help.

melanie cruz morales “Help! Help! Call the ambulance. My dad is unresponsive.”

annie correal

So Martin, who was doing OK and trying to get through this at home, is suddenly unconscious.

melanie cruz morales I called the ambulance.

annie correal

So Melanie calls 911.

melanie cruz morales I had to lock my mom and my dad in my room.

annie correal

The twins’ mother is immunocompromised, so they’re very nervous that she could get sick. And so when Kobe comes to the door and bangs on the door and says, “My dad is unconscious, he’s unresponsive,” they don’t even open the door.

annie correal Did you let him into your apartment? melanie cruz morales No.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. I have to imagine that that was really hard for the twins and for everybody, I mean, given what an open household this was. People going in and out of each other’s apartments all the time, and suddenly, a locked door and cousins who won’t let somebody in.

annie correal

Absolutely. I think it’s something that the twins are still struggling with now.

melanie cruz morales It was the hardest thing I had to do, but I knew that my mom’s immune system is so weak that I wasn’t going to risk putting her in danger. So I just said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but I can’t.” It was just a fight or flight reaction.

annie correal

I think it added a layer of just horror to be listening to all of this over the phone or even through the wall.

annie correal So you call 911, and you’re just waiting for the ambulance.

annie correal

So they have Kobe, their cousin, on one line, the paramedics on the other. And the ambulance arrives. And they’re guiding them over the phone through the apartment complex, so they can get to the right door.

melanie cruz morales We were kept on the line. So we heard everything through that phone call. We might have not been there, we might have not been able to see it, but we definitely heard it.

michael barbaro

And what are they hearing as they’re guiding these paramedics in and as the paramedics arrive across the hall?

annie correal

So they’re hearing them run up the stairwell and go into the apartment, and they’re pressed against the door and against the wall.

melanie cruz morales I had to comfort my cousin through the phone. I had to hear his yell. I could hear everything.

annie correal

They hear their cousin Kobe talking to his father, and he’s saying to him, “Don’t go, come back.” And at some point, he’s overcome, and he just throws the phone. And they can’t hear anymore what’s going on, except for these muffled sounds, these panicked sounds as they try to revive Martin.

melanie cruz morales We hear the yells and the cries, and we knew what was going on.

annie correal

And you have to imagine that his wife and his two young children are also in the apartment at the same time. So the twins are waiting. They say that it’s just the worst 25 minutes of their life. And then there’s silence. And they look through the peephole, and they see the body taken down the stairs.

melanie cruz morales The people from the funeral home come and dragged my uncle’s body down the stairs, and that definitely changes a person. There’s nothing that will prepare you for that. And I was left cold. I was left numb. I couldn’t cry. There was no tears coming down my face because I had never ever processed something like that. Our lives completely changed.

michael barbaro

That’s horrible.

annie correal

It is. But then the twins learned that the neighbors who lived across the hall from Javier on the second floor, they’re sick, too.

melanie cruz morales So when we heard that that family who lived across my uncle Javier was also getting sick, that’s immediately when I went into full panic mode and said I have to get out of here.

annie correal

It starts feeling like the coronavirus is just ripping its way through the building.

melanie cruz morales It felt like I was literally trapped in something that I couldn’t get out of, and it just felt like I needed to get out. Like I want — we all did. Like, my mom, my dad, my brother, like everyone felt the need to leave.

annie correal

And so they start planning some sort of escape. Through a connection, they find a home out in rural Pennsylvania, and they just start throwing things literally out the window.

melanie cruz morales We were throwing bags of clothes outside our window because we weren’t going to risk getting anything caught, like in the air of like the staircase, how like they had to pull my uncle’s body down through the stairs, and like we were just so panicked.

annie correal

Their refuge and their family home has turned into what feels like a death trap.

melanie cruz morales We felt like the virus was every corner. So it was survival. It was running for your life.

annie correal

And so they are just gathering everything that they can and fleeing into a car and eventually making their way out into the farmlands of Pennsylvania.

michael barbaro

Do the twins have any idea how this happened, how Javier got sick, whether he may have passed it on to his brother Martin, and then onto the others in the apartment?

annie correal

It’s all kind of speculation. I mean, he traveled to Mexico, so they think, was it making his way back to New Jersey? Could it have been on one of his work trips? Was it maybe Martin who picked it up as he continued to work? There’s really no way to trace how it made it into the apartment complex and why it hit them so hard. Another thing that has really struck me as I’ve talked to many, many families in the immigrant communities of New York and New Jersey is that many people who have been hospitalized or died, they didn’t even know if they had pre-existing conditions because they never sought out a doctor or treatment unless it was really an emergency that you’d go to the emergency room for, like an accident or a broken leg. They would just kind of soldier on.

michael barbaro

But what seems so striking to me about Javier is that he was attentive to his health. He tried over and over again to get a test, and it was such an ordeal. There were so many obstacles.

annie correal

I mean, it’s maddening looking back, and I think it’s worth keeping in mind that that’s what a lot of people were experiencing, whether they were immigrants or not, citizens or not. People were kind of groping around in the dark and not understanding how this virus worked or how quickly it could become a critical illness. I think what is interesting, though, is that in this family, one man died in the hospital, and although his life wasn’t saved, he had doctors and nurses and people checking his oxygen. And the other man stayed at home and drank home remedies of ginger and garlic and never saw a doctor at all. And I think you have to multiply that scenario by many, many thousands to understand why it will be a long time before we begin to grasp the effect on the marginalized communities in America, including the undocumented, because so many people died at home.

michael barbaro

Hm. Of course, the irony here is that the man in the hospital, the man at home — having the privileges that one brother did, citizenship, health care, access to a hospital, it didn’t seem to make a difference.

annie correal

Right. And that’s the irony, that the outcomes were the same.

[music]

michael barbaro

Annie, I wonder how the twins are making sense of all this. I mean, this uncle that they idolized and who had such a vision for what America could be for the family and who did everything right, he was not protected from this virus.

annie correal

Yeah, I think that that’s a challenge that they’re grappling with because I don’t suggest that these young women are naive at all. But I think seeing this, seeing it firsthand that their uncle who did everything that one is supposed to do, the fact that he still somehow fell through the cracks and that he wasn’t seen right away, I think it created a lot of confusion and maybe even disillusionment. This sense of their community was still somewhat on the margins even when they tried to do everything right.

[praying in spanish]

michael barbaro

Annie, when did you last speak with the twins, and how are they doing?

annie correal

So the last time I spoke with them was in the first weeks of May, and they had been living out there in rural Pennsylvania just with their brother and their parents and staying far away from everyone else.

[praying in spanish]

annie correal

So Melanie tells me that every day, they gather for a prayer circle. And one recent evening, they’d had a really hard day.

melanie cruz morales Some days, we have really bad, sad days. And that day was just sad.

annie correal

And the twins are really asking themselves, what are we even doing here?

melanie cruz morales Within this pandemic, we’ve been reflecting our entire life and time here in the United States and really saying, is it worth it? Why are we even here?

annie correal

So that night, Sheila asks God for some sign.

sheila cruz morales I don’t ask for much, but I need a sign to keep going.

annie correal

And later that night, Melanie gets an email. There’s an update from Georgetown.

melanie cruz morales And I was like, oh my god, like, I’m not ready to hear any news whatsoever anymore. Like, throw the whole phone away. I don’t want to see it. So I said, just me and Sheila and my brother are going to be in our room, and we’re going to open our decision. And I opened my notification first, but in that moment, I really, really forgot how to read, and I couldn’t understand anything until — it took me like a good minute for me to finish reading the letter, and then that’s when I started screaming. And I started crying. And I was, like, “I got in.”

annie correal

She’s been admitted to her first choice and been invited to transfer to Georgetown to finish her four year degree.

melanie cruz morales Then my sister checked her phone at the same time, and she also started screaming. And then we were both like, “Oh my god,” we both got in. And it was the happiest day that my family and I had had in the longest time because we had done everything to make this possible, and we had forgotten about it for a second because of this pandemic. But like I said, it was always in the back of my mind. And it was a sign.

annie correal

So suddenly, they go from, you know, sort of having to be the adults in the family to getting to be excited 19-year-olds again.

melanie cruz morales Dear Melanie, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that the committee of admissions has admitted you to Georgetown University. I am happy to offer you a place at the university beginning in the fall of 2020. This year, the committee —

annie correal

They also saw it, as I understand it, as a bit of encouragement from their uncle Javier, because for all of the obstacles, he was a believer in the possibilities. And we all have to make sense of the things that happen to us one way or another. So whatever it means, it does offer them a little bit of relief, a sense that the future might hold good things in this country.

michael barbaro

Not just awful things.

annie correal

Not just awful things.

melanie cruz morales One time in the summer, I was with him outside in the parking lot, and he was asking me about all these schools, and then he asked me, “Where do you want to go after you graduate from Bergen?” And I told him “I want to go to this really good school in Washington D.C. It’s called Georgetown. Bill Clinton went there, all these senators, congressmen, they all went there.” And he was like, “Wow, I know one day you’re going to do it. I know that you and your sister are going to get in, and the day that you get accepted, I’m going to post it on my Facebook and brag to all my friends that I have really smart nieces.” annie correal So did you post on your Facebook so that his family could see and the family could see in Mexico? melanie cruz morales Yeah, I posted it. I know that my uncle knew. And I know that he was with me that day. And I know that he’s proud and he believed in me and my sister. So it’s been hard, but I know that he’s with us, and that gives me comfort. I never understood what people meant when they say — when they talk about when someone passes away, and they’re like, “They’re with you, you can feel them.” But that night, I completely felt my uncle with me.

[music]

annie correal Well, again, I want to thank you for your tremendous generosity with your time and your experience. And I know that it’s hard and not easy. So I hope after this two and a half hour call, that you will breathe some fresh air and be with your family. melanie cruz morales Yes, I definitely will. But thank you again for giving me an opportunity to tell our story and document this. And I know that 10 years from now on, where I’ll be able to look back as this and, whichever position I am able to be, that our story will help define the history and the moments that we are going through right now. annie correal Thank you again, Melanie. melanie cruz morales You’re welcome. Have a good night. annie correal Bye bye.

[music]

michael barbaro

The Mexican government said that as of last week, close to 650 Mexican nationals have died from the coronavirus in the New York City area, by far the highest toll anywhere in the U.S. Sheila and Melanie have reached their goal of raising $30,000 to send their uncles’ remains back to Mexico. But for now, their ashes are still sitting inside of a church in New Jersey.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Here’s what else you need to know today. Over the holiday weekend, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus reached nearly 100,000, a staggering milestone that the Trump administration at one point had predicted would never be reached.

archived recording A month ago, you and President Trump were both talking about a total of 60,000 Covid-19 deaths. Early this coming week, we’re going to reach 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus, and those models that you’re citing now talk about close to 150,000 deaths by August. What happened, doctor? archived recording (deborah birx) I think a few things are together —

michael barbaro

In interviews on Sunday, White House pandemic coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx was asked about what turned out to be an inaccurate estimate of the death toll from the White House.

archived recording (deborah birx) So from the beginning, and I think when we had that first briefing, we talked about 1.2 million to 2.4 million and 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing to this incredibly aggressive virus. Those are the figures that we continue to stand by in this first wave.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has banned travel from Brazil because of the outbreak there, adding the country to a growing list of nations, including China, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, whose residents can no longer enter the U.S.

archived recording (mike pence) What you hear the president saying today is just a very reasonable request of the governor of North Carolina. We all want to be in Charlotte. We love North Carolina. But —

michael barbaro

On Monday, the president and vice president threatened to pull the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina this summer because the governor there cannot ensure full attendance under the state’s social distancing rules.

archived recording (mike pence) I think the president is absolutely intent on ensuring that, as we see our nation continue to make steady progress on putting the coronavirus epidemic in the past, that come this August, we’ll be able to come together in a safe and responsible venue and renominate President Donald Trump for four more years.

I was driving on my way home. And I began to feel that the car I had just purchased was a lemon because the wheels appeared to be running off the car. I managed to stop the car. And I looked in stupefaction at the road about 10 feet ahead of me and saw the road break open, and then, like two big halves of a huge sandwich, start moving like scissors back and forth, one half moving in one direction, the other half moving in the other direction. And all the time, while watching the road, it suddenly dawned on me that this was not an ordinary disaster, that it was perhaps one of the greatest disasters to hit North America. I kept thinking, what will Alaskans do now? What will Alaskans do now?

There are moments when the world we take for granted instantaneously changes, when reality is abruptly upended and the unimaginable overwhelms real life. We don’t walk around thinking about that instability, but we know it’s always there. At random and without warning, a kind of terrible magic can switch on and scramble our lives. You may know the feeling. In 1964, it happened to Anchorage, Alaska and to a woman named Genie Chance.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the great Alaska earthquake was the biggest earthquake to ever hit North America. John Mooallem, author of the book “This is Chance!,” on the story of that disaster and the voice that held the state together. It’s Friday, May 22.

john mooallem

Sunday, February 23, 1964, a month before the earthquake —

[small dogs bark]

— just before 1:00 PM.

archived recording Dog team on the trail.

john mooallem

The deciding heat of the world championship sled dog races was about to start.

archived recording They have estimated the crowd as high as 12,000 people.

john mooallem

And all of Anchorage, it seemed, had gathered downtown to watch.

archived recording And this is the one time of the year, the only time of the year, we ever get that many people into Alaska’s largest city. And I think it’s a wonderful thing.

john mooallem

The races were one of the longest running traditions in a community that didn’t have a lot of traditions yet, something for the fledgling city to look forward to in the coldest, loneliest stretch of winter.

archived recording Yes, you are thanks to the City of Anchorage. But we’ll be back with more after this important message. (SINGING) Buckle up for safety. Buckle up.

john mooallem

Anchorage, Alaska in 1964 was a blotch of Western civilization in the middle of emptiness. Alaska had only become the country’s 49th state five years earlier. And it was often disregarded as a kind of free-floating addendum to the rest of America.

archived recording (SINGING) Now listen to the saga of —

john mooallem

But Anchorage was Alaska’s biggest and proudest city, a community whose essential spirit, one visitor wrote, “reached aggressively and greedily to grasp the future, impatient with any suggestion that such things take time.”

archived recording (SINGING) — Black Label Beer.

[whistle]

john mooallem

It was a modern-day frontier town that imagined it was a metropolis —

archived recording OK, back here with more action.

john mooallem

— straining to make itself real.

archived recording Here’s the countdown now. Five, four, three, two, one. Go. All right. OK, here we go! It’s one o’clock dog-mushing time. Keith Breier is off to a real fine start. 11 dogs lining up very nicely —

john mooallem

A local radio station, KENI, was covering the races —

archived recording Keith Breier should be out to 15th and Cordova. Let’s go down to Genie Chance. Come in please, Genie.

john mooallem

— and threw the broadcast to a part-time reporter named Genie Chance —

archived recording (genie chance) Yes, here is Genie Chance at 15th and Cordova.

john mooallem

— who’d just gotten set up at a radio checkpoint at the top of Cordova Hill.

archived recording (genie chance) — just about a block and a half away from us —

john mooallem

— right as the sleds dashed by.

archived recording (genie chance) And he is running strong. The crowds have gathered —

john mooallem

Genie was relieved she’d made it in time. She was the only woman covering the event for KENI. And her bosses had given her a tough assignment.

archived recording (genie chance) It’s the largest crowd we’ve had at this checkpoint.

john mooallem

She’d started the day at a spot at the beginning of the course. But once she’d broadcast her play by play there, she had to scramble along a few miles of icy roads to this checkpoint, further along the route —

archived recording (genie chance) Here they come through. They’re running strong.

john mooallem

— before the dogs plowed by her again.

archived recording (genie chance) Beautiful. And he’s getting a big hand. I’m sure you can hear the people. He’s headed right, going down that hill.

john mooallem

But she’d made it. Because professionally, Genie Chance was relentless.

archived recording (genie chance) And this is Genie Chance returning it to Seppala Center.

john mooallem

She had to be.

[guitar music]

Genie was said to be the first female newscaster in Alaska. At 37 years old, she was strikingly beautiful, with short, wavy blond hair and high-cut bangs. She grew up in a small town in Texas, where she’d met her husband, Winston, and had three kids. There, Winston sold used cars, but he wasn’t particularly good at it. Even when he did manage to land a commission, he had a habit of blowing it on a steak dinner and drinks before he got home. The financial strain started to destabilize their marriage. And the pressure fell on Genie to hold the family together and make their precarious life feel safe. We’re not poor, she’d tell her children. We just don’t have any money. At the time, a wave of young Texans was decamping for jobs in Alaska. And Winston was convinced it was a land of opportunity, where anyone willing to work could wind up flush. But Genie hesitated. Alaska didn’t sound like a fun adventure to her. It sounded desolate and dreadful, like moving to the Moon. Then again, if life didn’t improve for her and Winston in Anchorage, maybe divorce might feel a little more feasible there. She’d be at the edge of the world. Nobody would have to know. But Alaska didn’t solve Winston’s troubles with money. And before long, the Chance family was unable to pay the rent. Winston said not to worry, he’d sell some cars soon. Genie worried. “And this is what a good wife is supposed to do?” she wrote. “Just wait at home for her man to bring money in to pay the bills and feed the family? If other wives do it all the time, why can’t I learn to relax and let it happen?” She went to Winston weeping one day, she said. And he told her, well, if you’re so worried about paying the rent, why are you sitting on your fat fanny? Get out there and get a job. Genie was speechless. Two weeks later, she got herself hired at KENI.

archived recording Coming up Cordova Hill, let’s go out to Genie Chance. archived recording (genie chance) Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. And he’s just now at the bottom of Cordova Hill. Here he is. His dogs too are looking real good.

michael barbaro

At the time, women broadcasters typically covered fashion and homemaking or hosted on-air recipe swaps. But in her year and a half at the station, Genie had forged a role for herself as an industrious roving reporter. She covered crime, and the courts, and city hall. She reported from crab boats and missile sites, burning buildings and Inuit villages, and sled dog races.

archived recording (genie chance) And immediately behind him, right on his heels is Dr. Lombard. So working real — no! No! It’s reverse. It’s reverse. Dr. Lombard —

michael barbaro

During the final stretch of the race, Genie lost herself in the excitement a little —

archived recording (genie chance) — both sides of dog and man alike working as a team —

john mooallem

— and just started shouting “oh” and “yes” into her microphone as the mushers passed.

archived recording (genie chance) Oh! Yes! And — oh!

john mooallem

And another KENI broadcaster appeared to make a sly, off-color crack about her breathlessness on the air.

archived recording (genie chance) What was the time when they came through here, Bill? archived recording You’re breathless, Gene. One minute, one hour, and —

michael barbaro

Genie tried to be gracious and stoic, to do what was expected of her without complaint. She figured this was the only way to defuse the discomfort of the men around her.

archived recording (genie chance) I’d like to thank all those who help make it possible for me to be a part of —

michael barbaro

At the end of the sled dog races that afternoon, she’d sign off by thanking not only all the KENI listeners and spectators —

archived recording (genie chance) — spectators who cheered me on.

john mooallem

— but her male co-workers too.

archived recording (genie chance) And I want to thank you, too, [INAUDIBLE],, Tye Park, and Bob Fleming for allowing this little gal to be a part of the biggest broadcast show ever —

michael barbaro

And she was also sure to thank her husband.

archived recording (genie chance) — my loving husband, Winston, who not only gave his permission but also his full cooperation, to our neighbor —

john mooallem

— for his permission.

archived recording (genie chance) Now, back to Seppala Center. archived recording Thank you, Genie. You did a fine job. And here’s Mike Seffin with a dog [INAUDIBLE] coming right over the finish line. Boy —

john mooallem

Sometimes, the future falls open without a warning. The earthquake, when it came, would knock people’s lives off kilter so brutally and abruptly that its power seemed to reverberate forever. Some people like Genie would find their lives oriented differently in its aftermath. Others would find their entire worldview had changed. More than half a century later, an attorney in Anchorage would explain, “even now, I can look at this solid ground out my window and know it’s not permanent. It can change anytime. It just moves. Everything moves.” Anyway, this is who Genie was and where everything stood before what it stood on moved. Friday, March 27, 1964, the night of the earthquake.

archived recording (genie chance) On the night of Good Friday, 1964, I was writing a letter to a friend in Juno.

john mooallem

Around 5:30, Genie Chance sat at the typewriter in her bedroom, stealing some time alone before fixing dinner for her husband Winston and their three children, eight-year-old Jan, 11-year-old Albert, and 13-year-old Winston Jr., or Wince, who just then appeared at her bedroom.

archived recording (genie chance) My son Wince came to me and said that he just had to get down to the bookstore to get —

john mooallem

He’d forgotten to buy a copy of the Red Cross lifesaving manual that he was supposed to bring to his swimming class the next morning.

archived recording (genie chance) And I said please, for heaven’s sakes, when you have to have something, don’t wait until the last minute. You’ve known —

john mooallem

So Genie pulled on a pair of boots and a parka and headed out.

archived recording (genie chance) So Wince and I got in the car. And I was still in somewhat of a unhappy mood about having to make a last-minute errand downtown.

john mooallem

At 5:36, snow is falling as Genie and Wince headed downtown. The city was quiet. As they approached the intersection of C Street and 9th, the traffic light turned red.

archived recording (genie chance) As I touched my brake, the car began to bounce.

michael barbaro

The car started bucking.

archived recording (genie chance) So I said, oh, no. And Wince says, what’s the matter? And I said, a blowout.

john mooallem

And Genie assumes she’d blown a tire.

archived recording (genie chance) And then it got worse.

john mooallem

She gripped the wheel. Wince held onto to his seat beside her. For a moment, they bounced violently without speaking a word.

archived recording (genie chance) Nothing was said between us for a few minutes. And I said, you know, it’s not a blowout. It must be a hard wind. And he said, boy, it’s a wind all right. But the car bounced worse and worse. And I lowered my window. And I heard a banging —

[distorted music]

— this clang banging. And I looked across. And on one corner of the intersection —

john mooallem

Cars parked in a line were slamming into one another and separating again, like a grotesque accordion opening and closing.

archived recording (genie chance) I saw down the street to my left two people holding on to each other, trying to stand up. Three people came —

john mooallem

The world and everything in it appeared to be convulsing. Genie’s eyes were seeing it, but her mind couldn’t organize all this information into a coherent story.

archived recording (genie chance) The car continued to bounce and bounce.

john mooallem

Suddenly, she watched the road roll away from the car —

archived recording (genie chance) It never did crack. It rolled.

john mooallem

— as though some humpbacked shadow creature were surging under its surface, heading for town. Finally, Genie found a word that could fasten together this chaos in her mind.

archived recording (genie chance) And I said, Wince, this is an earthquake. Wince could only say, yeah.

[gentle music]

john mooallem

The great Alaska earthquake lasted 4 and 1/2 minutes. It overwhelmed people the way the strongest emotions do. It was pure sensation, coming on faster than the intellect’s ability to register it. It was amazing what details people noticed, the focal points their minds locked on to when the world went blurry. On Fourth Avenue, a high school track star watched the window of a stationery store rattle and explode. And he stood there, admiring the perfect, hurdling form of the man who came leaping out of it. At Presbyterian Hospital, one man watched blood seeping into the hall from under a doorway, like a scene in a horror movie. It took a second for him to realize that the hospital’s blood bank had broken open and spilled. At the J.C. Penney department store, a 15-year-old in the elevator with some friends watched a book that one of them had dropped suddenly levitate off the floor and hang weightless in midair right in front of him. For a split second, it was like they were in orbit. The elevator was falling.

[intense music]

But Genie’s mind had already turned to reporting the news.

archived recording (genie chance) And as soon as it stopped, I looked up. And I could see that our television tower was still standing. And —

john mooallem

She assumed her station would have power back on soon and that the 6 o’clock news broadcast would go on as usual. That meant she had less than 20 minutes to put together a story.

archived recording (genie chance) And I knew we had no power by the fact that the traffic lights went out. But I knew that our very ingenious engineers would have us on the air very shortly. And not realize —

john mooallem

So Genie sped to the public safety building, where the police and fire departments were headquartered, to round up some details for a quick report.

archived recording (genie chance) As I dashed in, I saw that all of their huge, heavy filing cabinets and desks were thrown face down on the floor. And my son, Wince, came running in the door. And he yelled, come quick. Penney’s is falling. Well, he —

john mooallem

Standing in the doorway of the public safety building, they could see the brand-new J.C. Penney department store. The building was a point of pride in Anchorage. Penney’s was one of the first major chain retailers to believe in Alaska enough to build in the city.

archived recording (genie chance) But as I stood there and watched, I saw —

john mooallem

But now, as Genie and Wince watched through the flurry of snow —

archived recording (genie chance) Big slabs of concrete walls silently break loose and start toward the ground. And —

john mooallem

The tremendous concrete panel from the exterior started to swing away from the building, as though on a hinge.

archived recording (genie chance) And it fell to the street with a roar, that deafening roar.

john mooallem

With the facade peeled off, parts of the store were now open to the cold air, exposed like the rooms of a dollhouse.

archived recording (genie chance) And Wince looked at me. And I saw horror in his eyes.

[gentle music]

john mooallem

All at once, she registered the extent of the wreckage surrounding her. A voice said something about people buried in the rubble. A group of men came running down the street, yelling Fourth Avenue is gone. And behind them, Genie could see the roof of a familiar building resting on the street, jabbed into the pavement at an incomprehensible angle.

archived recording (genie chance) Then was the first time that I thought, the first thing I must do before I can go any further is get my family together and make sure everything is all right. I wheeled out of there and headed home. Oh, before we got home, I could see the house was still standing. And I remember breathing out loud, thank god. And Wince —

john mooallem

As she pulled up, Jan and Albert shot out of the neighbor’s house across the street. Wince leapt out of the car and ran to his sister and brother.

archived recording (genie chance) I said, Penney’s has fallen down, and there is more damage downtown. And Al then pulled off from me, and he looked at me very soberly, and he said, I’m all right. Don’t worry about me. Go on and do your job.

john mooallem

All three Chance children began to understand without being told that their mother would be leaving again.

[upbeat music]

Genie was proud of how self-sufficient her kids had become. But whatever pride she felt was undercut by guilt. She knew her family was growing independent of her out of necessity, because she wasn’t around as much as other mothers and wives were. Down in the lower 48, the women’s movement was underway. But Anchorage was 1,500 miles away from the rest of America. And “feminism” wasn’t a word Genie used. Her struggle to balance work and family felt like a problem unique to her. And isolated moments could trigger self-doubt. At breakfast one morning a few weeks earlier, the family was watching through the kitchen window as their neighbor scraped the ice off her husband’s Cadillac before he left for work. This was the custom among many Anchorage wives. But in the Chance home, the roles were reversed. Winston warmed up the car for Genie. Now, Winston asked her, honey, if I get you a Cadillac like that, would you scrape the ice off and warm it up yourself? There must have been a tinge of disgruntlement in his voice because, before Genie could answer, eight-year-old Jan interrupted to remind her father that he was actually very lucky. It’s not everyone who gets to warm up the car for Genie Chance. It was funny, but uncomfortable. And in hindsight, it might feel ominous, too, since after the earthquake, the more successful Genie became, the more Winston seethed.

[music]

It was nearly six o’clock, about 20 minutes since the quake, the last half hour of daylight.

archived recording (genie chance) So I headed immediately back down to the downtown area, still thoroughly confident we would be on the air in a very short time and I would have to have something to say. And —

john mooallem

As Genie headed back downtown, she kept her transistor radio tuned to KENI, hoping the station would be back on air in time for the hourly newscast. But so far, nothing, only static.

archived recording (genie chance) I went on down toward Penney’s on the —

john mooallem

Within minutes, she was back at J.C. Penney.

archived recording (genie chance) And got the car parked about a half block —

john mooallem

She parked and approached the store, but stopped short in front of a slab of something in the snow. She stared at it, mesmerized and repulsed, but couldn’t place what it was. She remembered, as a girl in Texas, watching her father kill off his few remaining hogs after a snowstorm and hang their fleshless hindquarters from the rafters of the barn. This thing in the snow reminded Genie of that somehow. Finally, a man shouted an explanation to her. It was half a woman, he said. He’d seen her get struck by the falling debris.

[ominous music]

Genie moved on quickly.

archived recording (genie chance) I went on over to Fourth Avenue to survey the damage there so that I could make a report. And I was horrified to discover that two whole blocks had simply fallen into a crack that had opened up, and there was no street under them.

john mooallem

For two whole blocks, everything was wedged in a ragged chasm that had ripped open under the street.

archived recording (genie chance) Fourth Avenue has just collapsed. It’s just collapsed.

john mooallem

Soon, an aftershock struck. The windows of a bank started popping, spraying glass across the sidewalk ahead of Genie as she headed back to her car. Her transistor radio still tuned to KENI continued to broadcast static. It was snowing hard. The sun was setting, the city going dark.

archived recording (genie chance) No telling how many people left at home without heat, and without power, and without telephones would think —

john mooallem

Genie knew that the citizens of Anchorage were scattered around, cut off from each other. The electrical grid was down. Most phone lines were dead. There’d be no way to know exactly what had happened or how thoroughly their world had been jumbled.

archived recording (genie chance) I realized that if there is any way I can be of service, I’ve got to do it.

[static]

I heard the weird strains of music coming over our KENI station.

[distorted music]

And I knew that our auxiliary unit had gotten on the air. We were on the air some way.

archived recording Because of the disaster we have just experienced and emergency condition which now exists —

john mooallem

When an announcer finally broke through —

archived recording (genie chance) I called in.

john mooallem

— Genie called the station from the portable radio unit in her car, explaining that she was ready to make a report about the situation downtown.

archived recording (genie chance) It has become obvious that the earthquake that struck Anchorage less than an hour ago was a major one. A great deal of damage —

john mooallem

She spoke fast, taking sharp, quick breaths.

archived recording (genie chance) The J.C. Penney building had two walls collapse. However, it is believed at this time that everyone who was inside the building managed to escape safely. There is a two-block portion on Fourth Avenue where the buildings just sunk into the ground.

john mooallem

She was astonished later when people told her she sounded calm.

archived recording (genie chance) KENI will keep you informed throughout the night. So stay tuned to your radios. Check on your neighbors. See if they have transistor radios. If they don’t, possibly they could move in with you and share one for the night. It seems like it’s going to be a long, cold night for Anchorage. So prepare to batten down the hatches. And stay tuned to KENI.

[upbeat music]

john mooallem

Genie drove back to the public safety building, where city officials were gathering. She told the fire chief and police chief that KENI was on the air again and that she had her mobile unit, ready to go live. They were free to use her rig to broadcast announcements. Without much thought, the police chief immediately offloaded that job on Genie. She was going to be the one talking to Anchorage, he told her.

[static]

archived recording (genie chance) Yes, Genie Chance inside civil defense headquarters here at the public safety building at the corner of 6th and C in Anchorage. We would like to —

john mooallem

She started reeling off the information she’d collected, taking uncertain stock of Anchorage’s wounds.

archived recording (genie chance) But there is apparently a great deal of damage just west of L Street there at Ninth Avenue. Of course, we’ve already — We have received word from the state police that the Eagle River bridge is passable. We had — The two docks owned by the oil companies down there at Seward are currently on fire.

john mooallem

She listed the locations of public shelters opening up for the displaced and started directing equipment and personnel around the city.

archived recording (genie chance) Anybody who has a spare chlorinator, they are in dire need of a chlorinator there at Providence Hospital. All electricians and plumbers, please go to Building 700. All line personnel, report to work as soon as possible.

[whooshing]

Well, we’re ready to go again. The plug got kicked here, and we ran out of power. I thought maybe it was one of those little tremors. I don’t know if you’re sitting up there in the studio. To contact Chuck Dummond. Chuck Dummond. He is needed urgently to install the chlorinator at Providence Hospital. Providence Hospital needs six cases of 6-inch plaster of Paris. This is a message for Mr. Grace. If he can manage to get that —

john mooallem

The city managers spoke through her —

archived recording (genie chance) All right, any fuel or —

john mooallem

— ordering her to put out a call for diesel fuel.

archived recording (genie chance) — diesel fuel oil down at the site of the turbine —

michael barbaro

A public health official stood over her shoulder.

archived recording (genie chance) In order to make it pure, you want —

john mooallem

— while she repeated his instructions for purifying snow for drinking.

archived recording (genie chance) You add 1 teaspoon of household bleach to every 5 gallons of water. Be sure not to just melt it, but boil it also. Right now, that is the latest we have to report from the inside civil defense —

john mooallem

Genie understood that everyone would be trapped together for the foreseeable future, in the snow, in the dark, with no electricity, in below freezing temperatures. Under those circumstances, she wrote later, mass hysteria would have meant total destruction.

archived recording (genie chance) The chlorinator, we’re happy to report, has been installed at Providence Hospital. Chuck Dummond did arrive.

john mooallem

Essentially, she was doing her job. She was talking to Anchorage on the radio. As one man put it, Genie Chance was telling everyone, you’re not alone.

archived recording (genie chance) KENI radio will fit in where we are needed and do our best to carry on 24 hours a day. We have another message to Mr. Nolly.

john mooallem

And that’s how the first hours unfolded. But something else was happening that Friday night too, the thread of this story that, as time passed, would come to feel almost like folklore.

archived recording (genie chance) Mr. And Mrs. R.W. Fisher have lost their children. They can’t find them. Mr. And Mrs. Fisher are at the home of Charles Ball. Mr. and Mrs. Fisher —

john mooallem

At the public safety building, ordinary people who were separated from their children or other family members started stumbling up to Genie’s counter and asking her for help. They were converging on Genie, desperate to know if somebody they loved was safe, to find one another, to shout across their fractured city in the dark.

archived recording (genie chance) Bill Noble would like to get a message if at all possible as to their whereabouts and if they are all right. Meryl Sleeger, who lives on 86th Avenue, please come home. Mr. and Mrs. Dick Fisher are still here at the police headquarters at 6th and C, waiting for any word of their children. Their home went off the bluff. They’re out there in the Turnagain area, where we understand a great deal of damage took place.

john mooallem

They hoped that Genie could amplify their voices with her own.

[gentle music]

And then, as the night went on —

john mooallem

A message to Kenneth Sadler, Mrs. Sadler is fine. Kenneth Sadler, he’s out in the bush and listens on a transistor radio. Mrs. Sadler is fine. A message to Walter Hart at Kenai, Lee Hart is fine. We have another message that Bob DeLose is all right. Tim Murphy and Bill Somerville at Point Hope, your families are A-OK. Frank Smith at Beluga, your family is safe and at the home of Red Dodge. I also have received a report from a person who is monitoring stations from the lower 48 states — All the people, one after another, calling in to report that they were OK. You could to hear the potential death toll in the city gradually ticking down. And with each small declaration of survival that aired, you could imagine a constellation of affirming flames slowly lighting the emptiness outside. Finally —

archived recording (genie chance) I’ve been so involved trying to assist down here in the coordination of the messages —

john mooallem

— it was Genie’s turn.

archived recording (genie chance) — that I really hadn’t stopped to think how worried and concerned my parents must be. So if my friends in Fairbanks would take down a message for me and get the word to my family in Bonham, Texas, that the Chance family is all right. Place a collect call to Judge A.S. Broadfoot, B-R-O-A-D-F-O-O-T, at Bonham, Texas, and tell him that the Chance family is all right. I’ll appreciate this if the message can get to Texas, for I know that my family, as well as everybody else’s, is very concerned.

john mooallem

It was still dark early on Saturday morning when the telephone rang at the home of Judge and Mrs. A.S. Broadfoot in Bonham, Texas. The caller explained that he had just received a phone call from his son, who lived in Fairbanks. There’d been a terrible earthquake in Alaska, his son told him. But believe it or not, he was listening to the Broadfoot’s daughter, Genie Chance, covering the disaster on the radio right now. And he’d just heard her ask for someone to phone her parents in Texas and tell them, the Chance family is all right.

[peaceful music]

The phone rang again. This time, it was a perfect stranger, a military officer in Fairbanks calling collect, just like Genie had instructed on the air. He was passing on the same message. The Chance family is all right. “From then on, the phone rang constantly,” Genie’s mother wrote. “I just let down and bawled in a boo-hoo of all time.” Back in Anchorage, 13 hours after the quake hit, Genie was still on the air. She’d been working straight through the night. And as the city went to sleep in the early hours of the morning, despite their power being out and their phone lines down, they’d been connected to one another once again.

Early that morning, as news of the great Alaska earthquake filtered into the outside word, word reached a small team of sociologists at the Disaster Research Center at Ohio State University. It was a brand new institute, funded by the Department of Defense, to send social scientists as quickly as possible to wherever a disaster struck.

The Cold War was escalating. And the military was desperate to prepare America for the possibility of nuclear war. One of its presiding assumptions was that a bomb dropped on the United States wouldn’t just cause physical destruction, but pandemonium, lawlessness, and violence among the survivors, too. The government needed to get a handle on how to manage that chaos. And they’d locked on to natural disasters as realistic proxies. Each community hit by an earthquake, hurricane, or flood would be like a laboratory, a full-scale simulation in which a team of sociologists could scrutinize that breakdown of society in advance.

The sociologists learned, for example, that when Presbyterian Hospital started filling with gas after the quake, Boy Scouts, who’d been distributing phone books in the neighborhood, help to walk all the hospital’s patients down three or four flights of stairs. And an armada of taxis and other civilian drivers pulled up outside to evacuate everyone to a second hospital across town.

Everywhere in Anchorage, clusters of ordinary people had gone straight to work, spontaneously, teaming up and switching on like a kind of civic immune response. They just started solving whatever problems they saw in front of them and often surprised themselves by how capably they were getting the job done. Genie was one of those people.

One man told the sociologists, “everybody jumped right in. Everybody was trying to do a little bit of everything for everybody.” Since then, an entire field of sociology has documented the same phenomenon in disasters around the world. And eventually, two founders of the Disaster Research Center would theorize about why, why disasters seemed to bring out the best in people. “In ordinary life,” they wrote, “we suffer alone. Any struggle, any pain winds up isolating us from other people or even making us resentful of everybody else, who seem to somehow have it easier. But in a disaster, an entire community suffers together. Trauma and even death, the stuff that we suppress in daily life, spills out as a public phenomenon for everyone to see. The present becomes all-consuming. The past and the future fall away. And all those who share in the experience,” the researchers wrote, “are brought together in a very powerful, psychological sense.” And something else happens. When everything gets scrambled, our assumptions about each other and ourselves get scrambled too. As another sociologist put it, “the instant disaster strikes, life becomes like molten metal. It enters a state of flux from which it must reset upon a principle, a creed, or purpose. It is shaken, perhaps violently, out of rut and routine.” What he’s really saying is in catastrophe, there’s an opportunity for transformation.

Genie finally stepped away from her microphone at three o’clock on Saturday. But she was back two hours later, claiming to have taken a nap. Journalists were descending on Anchorage by then. And Genie spoke with one group from Europe, and was taken aback when they instantly recognized her name. Oh, yes, they told her, we’ve heard you on the radio. Her voice had traveled around the world, spraying out of Anchorage on an array of convoluted paths.

As the story of the disaster started to be written, Genie became one of its recurring characters. The media called her the voice of Alaska, the stand-in for the resourcefulness and composure of an entire state. The quake had temporarily unraveled the fabric of society. And Genie had found the space to slip through. But then that fabric stitched together again, and Genie didn’t fit. She asked KENI for a raise, but was told that she was already making the highest salary for a woman. She quit the same day. At home, Winston felt increasingly overshadowed by her. It turns out he’d been physically abusing Genie for years. And now, it got worse. Eventually, she was through with it. She filed for a divorce. Soon, people around Anchorage were asking her if she’d ever thought about running for office. And she’d spend the better part of the ‘70s in the Alaska State Legislature, ramming through as much progressive legislation as she could, often while wearing a frosted blond wig, short skirt, and white gogo boots on the chamber floor. As one of Genie’s young aides put it to me, “she was making up for lost time.” January 8, 2017, 53 years after the earthquake. I’m sitting in a basement in Juneau, Alaska, surrounded by boxes of Genie Chance’s things. Genie’s daughter Jan has kept them all here for years, not knowing what to do with them. There were 38 boxes in all, filled with reel-to-reel recordings of radio broadcasts, old diaries, and letters, and photographs. And I’d spend days in Jan’s basement over the next couple of years looking through all of it, at every document inside, from a lock of Genie’s baby hair to one of her campaign posters, with a photo of her in a fur-lined parka, holding a radio microphone. And that image of her might have seemed like the fairy-tale ending to the story of Genie and the earthquake, except I was starting to realize that this story is about the deceptiveness of such endings, the potential for circumstances that feel conclusive and stable to randomly come apart. Because there were more boxes after that, lots of them. And in those, Genie lost her seat in the legislature to a slimy Californian transplant who ran a bareknuckled campaign. Wince, the son who’d been with her in the car the evening of the quake, was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1990, just shy of his 40th birthday. And her other son, Al, was in and out of rehab and would die a few years after that. Then Genie’s second husband died. And as soon as he was gone, Genie was hit by dementia, hard. That’s why the boxes were there, unopened. Genie had packed them up, planning to write her autobiography, but she never got the chance.

[mellow music]

I’ll be honest. It was pretty depressing. I’d never heard of Genie Chance. I’d never even heard of the Great Alaska Earthquake. And it was unsettling that something so consequential, the most powerful earthquake in North America, could recede so invisibly into history. To take in a stranger’s entire life at that speed, blurred and compressed so dramatically, started to make me feel like maybe time itself was a slow-moving natural disaster that eventually shakes everything apart. And from such a telescopic distance, it was impossible not to recognize the form that all our lives assume, a forgettable blip, a meaningless straight line from birth to death. At some point, sitting in that basement, I started picturing my own boxes in one of my own daughters’ basements one day. And then I imagined how many other sets of boxes are already out there and how many people hadn’t left boxes at all. But — and maybe this part’s harder to explain — it doesn’t feel depressing to me now because I also know that, sealed inside this vulnerable little snow globe we call the present, life feels anything but forgettable and meaningless, and that recognizing the starkness of it all, the course our straight line is taking, liberates us into the present. It imbues life with immediacy, just like a disaster does. And just like disaster, it gives us the chance to expand those boundaries the only way we can, by reaching out, by connecting our lives to the lives of others, by thatching our lines together like a net.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: From the earliest days of the coronavirus, health officials believed that it largely spared children and teenagers, but recently that belief has been challenged. My colleague Pam Belluck on the story of a 14-year-old boy whose case is being studied to better understand the impact of the virus on children. It’s Thursday, May 21. Pam, when does this understanding that we all seem to have about the coronavirus and how it spares children, when does that start to change?

pam belluck

In late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said we’re noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms of inflammation. We don’t really know what this is about. Some have tested positive for coronavirus. Some haven’t. And it was just kind of saying we think we’re seeing something. So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided, well, we don’t really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number of cases. We can’t even say for certain that it’s connected to coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch it. And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital in New York City. The person said we’ve got two cases of this syndrome that they’ve been talking about in the UK. If you want to talk to somebody, let us know. And that’s how I got to know Jack McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this visit.

pam belluck

It’s a very warm, kind of cozy apartment. There are all these “welcome home” banners and balloons for Jack. And the family, Jack and his father John and his mother Doris, they just immediately welcomed me and our photographer Gabriela in, and they all just start talking. I just know immediately I have to put on my tape recorder because there’s no way I’m going to capture all this writing things down.

john mcmorrow He sent him a letter. jack mcmorrow Yes. Can I explain something — john mcmorrow Oh, come on. I’m giving backdrop here. You can explain all you want. jack mcmorrow No. First of all, I wanted to talk about how the virus was behaving like a bacteria. john mcmorrow OK, you’re gonna, but I just want to say — jack mcmorrow That was way back when. john mcmorrow — Randall — jack mcmorrow This thing’s probably not picking up anything. doris stroman I hope you know she’s taping all of you because — john mcmorrow Yeah, we barter like this all day long. doris stroman I got a bell from school — jack mcmorrow Stop with the bell. doris stroman — because they bicker. And I have to do this — john mcmorrow And it’s a timeout bell. doris stroman — and tell them to both go to each corner. jack mcmorrow I’m sorry about all this chaotic — pam belluck It’s wonderful. It’s wonderful. [bell ringing] john mcmorrow And these cleaned arteries, they have to bring you right back. jack mcmorrow I was coherent at this time. john mcmorrow No, I know. But I know you’ve been jumping things, and I know when you’re excited. jack mcmorrow Me jumping things? pam belluck You’re doing great. You’re doing great. jack mcmorrow Dad, you went from day one to me in the new I.C.U. That’s like a — doris stroman Do I need to get my bell? jack mcmorrow — huge jump. Dude, if — speaker Oh my God.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this family. Who are they?

pam belluck

So Jack’s father is John McMorrow.

john mcmorrow I know it’s your story, son.

pam belluck

He is a truck driver. He works as a Teamster for the film industry. He was recently laid off because of the pandemic. And his mother, Jack’s mother, is Doris Stroman. She works at a lab school with five and six-year-old kids. She was wearing a mask that had The Rolling Stones tongue logo on it.

doris stroman — to figure out what was going on, starting with his pediatrician.

pam belluck

And Jack is 14. He’s a ninth grader. He goes to Catholic school in Queens.

jack mcmorrow Yeah, and I have a whole bunch of other prop replica stuff. pam belluck So you’re a Star Wars fan? jack mcmorrow I like Marvel a lot more than I do — pam belluck Oh, you’re more of a Marvel person. OK. jack mcmorrow This is the Infinity Gauntlet from “Avengers: Infinity War.” I really have to — doris stroman They don’t have time for that, Jack. jack mcmorrow This is why —

michael barbaro

And, Pam, what is the story that Jack and his parents tell you about this mysterious condition that he has?

pam belluck

So Jack was living the world of a New York City teenager in a pandemic.

doris stroman He never left the house. jack mcmorrow I haven’t left — john mcmorrow Since March 13, he’s been in the house. doris stroman You never left the house. His school — john mcmorrow In his room, not even in here. doris stroman His Catholic school was one of the first that were closed. pam belluck Oh wow. doris stroman Didn’t leave the house.

pam belluck

March 12 was his last day of school, and he was doing the online learning thing.

doris stroman The one time he left the house other than — was to help me with the laundry and didn’t want to touch anything. jack mcmorrow I took a shower after I came up from the laundry room. doris stroman Yeah, the kid just — jack mcmorrow I’m a germophobe.

pam belluck

They just kind of stayed in. He was playing video games. He was chatting with his friends and that kind of thing. That was Jack’s world.

[music]

Then in mid-April, Jack’s parents start to notice some unusual things.

john mcmorrow Three weeks ago, he came out to me with a rash on the backside of his hands. jack mcmorrow Yeah. john mcmorrow I thought it was — jack mcmorrow It was bad. john mcmorrow — from the antibacterial soap. You know, Purell. Maybe he’s doing it too much. He’s sensitive. jack mcmorrow Yeah, for like — we thought it was nothing more than eczema. john mcmorrow And then I think a day or two later he — jack mcmorrow No, it was like — john mcmorrow — your mother told you something about your eyes. She thought you were playing video games too much. jack mcmorrow Yeah, the eyes definitely, but I don’t know if that was —

pam belluck

They went on, and then the next week — and this was April 21 —

jack mcmorrow I had got a normal fever, like 101, 102.

pam belluck

— Jack gets a fever.

jack mcmorrow I woke up one day with — doris stroman Sore throat. jack mcmorrow — sore throat. That was the first inflammation symptom that we had, which was — doris stroman On his hands, on his feet — jack mcmorrow On my hands, on my feet — doris stroman — on his neck. jack mcmorrow — and on my neck. That was the first —

pam belluck

And then around Friday, April 24, things start to get more severe.

jack mcmorrow That ended up being a swollen lymph node that grew to about the size of a tennis ball that you could visibly see coming on the side of my neck. doris stroman That was alarming.

pam belluck

By the next day, Saturday morning, he wakes up and he’s got a 104.7 fever.

michael barbaro

That is a real fever.

pam belluck

That is a serious fever. They call their pediatrician at 7:30 in the morning, and she says, you guys, you got to get to an urgent care clinic, and they do. And there he gets a coronavirus test, but it’s going to be a couple days before he gets the results.

michael barbaro

So at this point they think it might perhaps be Covid-19.

pam belluck

It doesn’t look like Covid-19, but we’re living in a world of Covid-19, and so I think that they are just sort of saying, well, let’s just test him. We don’t really know what this is. They send him home. Things just keep getting worse and worse. And by Monday morning, Jack wakes up. He cannot move. He can’t move.

jack mcmorrow Because I wake up, and to even sit up, I screamed for them. And I had 105 almost.

pam belluck

And he’s lying on the couch.

jack mcmorrow I was sleeping with my socks on, and he kind of saw red. And he takes off my socks to reveal my entire feet, right here, had just rashes on the insides and bottom. doris stroman At that time — jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman — we thought that was the apex. jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman But it wasn’t until days later. jack mcmorrow Yeah, they thought that was bad. My hands here on my palms, a little bit at the back, all rashes. So my skin — to even touch my skin and feel —

pam belluck

It’s terribly, terribly frightening. And he says to me, I was very emotional.

jack mcmorrow I’m using the word emotional to try and cover up the fact I was crying like a baby. It was so bad.

pam belluck

They happen to have a home blood pressure monitor, so they take his blood pressure. And this is where, as if all of these symptoms weren’t alarming enough and frightening enough, the blood pressure is very low. And so they know they had to take him to the hospital. They had to figure out how to get him out of the house. He can’t move. So John and Jack kind of demonstrate this for me.

jack mcmorrow I put my hands on his arms like this and, not kidding, shuffled my way. john mcmorrow And I had to then hold him up — jack mcmorrow With his arms.

pam belluck

John picks him up, puts Jack’s feet on top of John’s feet, and then walks backward out the apartment door, sort of shuffling Jack along.

doris stroman And when we got to the hospital — john mcmorrow They took a wheelchair. doris stroman — they took a wheelchair. jack mcmorrow Yeah, I took a wheelchair. doris stroman He couldn’t walk. john mcmorrow He couldn’t walk no more. He couldn’t bend his legs.

pam belluck

So he gets to the hospital. They are trying to figure out, again, what’s going on. They don’t know.

john mcmorrow — everything back and forth. You had a cardiologist department. You had the pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts, and then you had the immunology all throwing numbers and prescriptions and how they count through each other to deal with him. And this is stuff that I — it’s French to me. You might as well just tell me —

pam belluck

And while he’s there, they get the coronavirus test results back from the clinic that he went to on Saturday two days earlier.

michael barbaro

And what does it say?

pam belluck

They’re negative. So they’re crossing that off the list. They say, we really should probably send you home because we don’t really know what this is, and we think maybe you can just kind of watch it at home.

doris stroman Because they were riding the wave that he tested negative.

pam belluck

Well, Doris is not happy about that. She says —

doris stroman And I said, well, he needs to be tested again. And she said, we only test those who are admitted. And I said, well, then he needs to be admitted. We have nowhere to be —

pam belluck

So there’s a communication around that. And they agree there’s no harm in doing another coronavirus test. Why not? We don’t really know what’s happening. Why not? So they do another coronavirus test. And then while they’re there waiting, another symptom emerges.

doris stroman When he woke up, his eyes were like this. And I was just like, what just — jack mcmorrow Yeah, they were rolling in the back of my head. doris stroman And they were red.

pam belluck

His eyes turned bright red. As his mom is telling me about this, she is pointing to a red pillow on their couch, and she says, it’s like this. And his eyes are rolling back into his head, and they’re bright red.

doris stroman He was like, I’m fine, I’m fine, like this. I’m fine. I’m fine. john mcmorrow When was this?

pam belluck

Then the doctor comes in and tells them that, guess what? The new coronavirus test, the second one, it was positive.

michael barbaro

Pam, how could that be that he has a negative test and just a few days later, suddenly a positive test?

pam belluck

Well, unfortunately this is kind of the reality of coronavirus testing right now that they are not 100 percent reliable. It’s a little bit of a Wild West situation. So there are cases of false negatives, and that’s obviously what was the case with Jack. So once they realize that he is Covid positive, they decide at that hospital that he’s got to go to a children’s hospital. And Jack is not on board with this. He does not want to go. And the doctor says to him, “If I send you home today, you will be dead by tomorrow.”

jack mcmorrow That, I would say, had scared me to death. But it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight.

pam belluck

So Jack gets to the children’s hospital in the ambulance. And the doctors take one look, and they realize, this is not what we thought coronavirus infection looks like. This is not the way it usually affects patients. And they know that by looking at Jack and figuring out what’s going on with him, they are going to learn a lot more about what this virus can do to kids.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jack mcmorrow I’m getting to the pain now. It was a throbbing, stinging rush of, like, you could feel it going through your veins.

pam belluck

So when Jack gets to the hospital, he is just exhausted and in so much pain.

jack mcmorrow You could feel — it was almost like someone injected you with straight up fire. Just fire.

pam belluck

The major symptom that’s going on with Jack is that he has very low blood pressure.

jack mcmorrow You’ve got to remember, my heart rate was at 165 while I was sleeping. That’s like a marathon runner.

pam belluck

And he has a very, very fast heart rate, because his heart is trying very hard to compensate for that low blood pressure that is preventing him from pumping oxygen and nutrients throughout his body to his critical organs. So that’s what they’ve got to treat. That is a condition that is called cardiogenic shock. It is heart failure. It is fatal if not treated. And he was telling me that he started to focus his energy. He started to feel like, I have got to understand what is going on with my body. I’ve got to know, because if I don’t know what I’m fighting, then I can’t fight it. So he starts to talk to the doctors.

jack mcmorrow They don’t get a lot of kids that can actually talk to them since it’s pediatrics.

pam belluck

And he’s a ninth-grade kid, and he’s been taking biology, and he has some understanding about the heart and the lungs and how they all work. And so he’s asking them lots of questions.

jack mcmorrow We were going back and forth with the whole — especially the way my heart related to my cardiovascular and circulatory system, never mind my —

pam belluck

And that made him feel much more in control, or at least it was a little bit less terrifying for him once he kind of realized what he could understand. But in that first day or two —

jack mcmorrow It was scary.

pam belluck

— he did feel like he wasn’t going to come out of it.

speaker It didn’t look like I was coming out of it the same, if at all.

michael barbaro

And how do the doctors try to treat Jack during this time?

pam belluck

So the first thing that they’re trying to do is give him blood pressure medication to try to get his blood pressure up, but it’s just not working. It’s been 48 hours. And they are so worried about his heart, which is not pumping enough oxygen to his body, that they think they’re going to need to put him on a ventilator.

michael barbaro

Wow.

john mcmorrow They were going to intubate him. And I said, you know, that was breaking my heart. doris stroman If they were to — john mcmorrow And so did they. They didn’t want it, because they know that they had to brace me on the realistic approach that only 20 percent come off.

pam belluck

So they say, well, you know, why don’t we try some steroids? Now, steroids are this widely used medication that works in a lot of different ways and works for some things, it doesn’t work for other things, and it’s really hard to know whether it’s going to help him or not. But within a few hours, he starts to stabilize. They decide they don’t need the ventilator, and —

jack mcmorrow They were bringing me Icees and ginger ale — john mcmorrow They were bringing him everything, lollipops — jack mcmorrow — and I hadn’t had water. john mcmorrow He hadn’t no water, nothing in his mouth for over 48 hours because they were — jack mcmorrow For 48 hours. john mcmorrow — preparing him to do the tube. jack mcmorrow My mouth was — I felt like I was dying. And then they were throwing Icees my way. They were like, here you go, kid. They gave me lollipops. They gave me ginger ales. I was, like, living the life.

pam belluck

So it seems like the steroids worked, but doctors actually don’t know that 100 percent. And John, Jack’s father, called the pediatrician, their longtime pediatrician, and said, what happened? I don’t know what happened. And —

john mcmorrow He laughed. And I said, why? Why? Why? How did this happen? What did he do? And he goes, I don’t know. I said, you know my family’s going to believe this was the power of prayer. And he goes, I’ll go with that, because we don’t know why. We don’t know.

My family is going to think that it’s a miracle. And the pediatrician says, well, that works for me because I don’t really know either.

michael barbaro

And Pam, beyond the steroids and whether or not those worked, what did the doctors understand about what was going on here?

pam belluck

Well, they’re kind of mystified. I mean, they’ve got this kid, and they know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesn’t have symptoms that kind of look like what they’ve come to expect from coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning they’ve had two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they don’t have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering. And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have what’s called an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had coronavirus infection. And they think, let’s just give these kids — these other kids that test and see. And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had coronavirus.

michael barbaro

Pam, at this point, what do the doctors think that this is exactly? Because all of these kids have had coronavirus, but most of them don’t still have it.

pam belluck

What they think is this may be a kind of second-stage effect of coronavirus that we didn’t know was possible, that we didn’t know was part of the way this virus worked. These kids didn’t get the lung problems, the breathing problems, that kind of assault on the lungs that is the primary way that coronavirus works. And so what the doctors think is that at the time of their infection, their immune system did a really good job of just swatting the infection away, of battling it away — that’s why they didn’t have any symptoms at the time. But that somehow in the course of that fight, their immune system got so revved up and so hyperactive that it generated this inflammatory response weeks later, and their bodies had this incredible overzealous reaction that went throughout their bodies and caused all sorts of havoc.

michael barbaro

So this is not coronavirus for kids. It’s some kind of later-down-the-line, affiliated set of horrible conditions that follows it.

pam belluck

Exactly.

michael barbaro

I mean, what seems particularly scary about this is that theoretically any kid who has had the coronavirus — and I have to imagine there are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these across the United States, people like Jack who probably showed no symptoms whatsoever from the original infection — it now seems possible that they could develop these really awful new secondary symptoms.

pam belluck

That’s exactly the risk here. That’s exactly the worry. We know that kids are just as likely to get infected as adults. They don’t have any protection from infection. A whole lot of them end up showing no symptoms. And we wanted to think that that meant that they really weren’t getting that sick. But now we have this thing that shows up weeks later, and we don’t have any idea who will end up with this inflammatory syndrome and when.

michael barbaro

I mean, what are the implications of that as we think about reopening schools, for example? I mean, one of the kind of saving graces, silver linings of this pandemic was that kids were supposed to be spared, and that understanding seems to have been the basis for plans to reopen schools. What does it mean that this second-stage set of symptoms is now starting to show up among children?

pam belluck

It definitely puts a serious complication in those plans. It’s something that governors, federal officials, they are already thinking about — they are going to have to think about. It’s not like you can test kids and say, OK, you’re negative, or you have antibodies, you’re going to be fine. Because you could have antibodies, and then you could end up with this. So it makes that issue much more tenuous and much more complicated, and I don’t think anybody has a good answer for that right now.

michael barbaro

And Pam, how is Jack doing at this point?

pam belluck

He’s doing OK. He’s home.

jack mcmorrow And I came home to take the best shower I’ve ever had in my entire life. Not even gassing it. It was like 30 minutes. doris stroman You can’t get him in, and then you can’t get him out. jack mcmorrow No, no, no. It was like — doris stroman You know. You have kids. jack mcmorrow It was like 30 minutes, this one. And it felt fine, and then I was like, I got to stop running around because I’m going to fall. I’m going to get lightheaded and pass out. But completely ignoring my own self advice, just ran into my room, put on my headphones, talked to my friends, and I said, I’m home! And they were all like, yeah! doris stroman Any time he runs around — jack mcmorrow And it was the best. doris stroman — and says I’m alive, I’m alive — jack mcmorrow No. doris stroman — we go, “I’m a real boy!” jack mcmorrow I’m a real boy. doris stroman I’m a real boy! jack mcmorrow No, no, no, because I said that. doris stroman From “Pinocchio.” jack mcmorrow No, because I was in the hospital, and I was like there are no strings on me because — john mcmorrow Because he did IVs —

pam belluck

He has some residual heart issues, but they think that his issues, because he’s so young and otherwise healthy, that he’ll probably emerge from this with no real issues. They are going to be following him. They’re going to be following these other kids, too, because this is still a mystery, and they don’t really know whether it’s going to have any long-term effects. And since his case, since his successful treatment, doctors have been using the same playbook on other kids with his issue. So they think that the steroids were what helped him, and they are giving other kids steroids a lot earlier when they come into the hospital. So far, apparently the results have been pretty encouraging. They are writing up Jack’s case, along with some of the other kids, in an article that’s going to be published in a medical journal. Jack was very excited to learn about that. And he said to me —

jack mcmorrow It’s been really good being back home, and I just want to do more with my life now, now that I have it back.

pam belluck

I really want to do something with my life, now that I have it back.

jack mcmorrow In any way that I can. pam belluck That is awesome. jack mcmorrow Yeah.

pam belluck

He said this while holding his Captain America shield. So I thought — [LAUGHTER]

michael barbaro

He is, after all, a 14-year-old.

pam belluck

He is, after all, a 14-year-old boy.

jack mcmorrow I literally sent my biology teacher an email, saying thank you for educating me. pam belluck Really? john mcmorrow Oh, that was the first thing he did. jack mcmorrow I can show you it if you want. john mcmorrow Yes. You should actually — pam belluck I would love to see it. john mcmorrow — show it. doris stroman No, no, not now. Not now. Let her have it so — pam belluck Yeah, why don’t you email it to me. doris stroman It’s long, so just let her read it when she gets a minute.

pam belluck

[READING JACK’S EMAIL] “OK, I’ll try to make this email quick, because I’m still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is the main reason I’m not at home recovering right now, but rather in a cardio-monitoring room. “As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my heart and my systems, I’m confident that I was able to keep up with the conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to keep fighting — or rather, to keep my vitals in check. “To summarize what I’m trying to say — and this is the honest truth — I would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most. Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system, I’m now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand the doctors and communicate to them. “I don’t want to drag this out, and I know I said that I’d try to make this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to know what I needed to know. I’m sorry for making this email so long, and I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously, I’m genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year. “I hope your family and yourself stay safe. Thank you.”

michael barbaro

That’s lovely.

pam belluck

Isn’t that amazing?

michael barbaro

Is he back in school remotely?

pam belluck

He is back. Jack is back in school remotely. He’s taking that biology class and he’s seeing his friends. And he is — he is being Jack.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Pam. We really appreciate it.

pam belluck

Thank you.

Last week, health officials gave Jack’s condition a name: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. So far, it has been found in about 200 children in the U.S. and Europe, and has killed several of them. Because the condition was just identified, it’s unclear how many cases have remained unreported. We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (andy beshear) Retail opened today. Big day, big step. And what we saw out there from everything that we could see is people trying really hard.

On Wednesday, two months after the pandemic began, all 50 states began reopening to varying degrees.

archived recording (andy beshear) And that’s important, because we have one shot at reopening the economy the right way.

michael barbaro

Kentucky permitted retailers to let in customers. Connecticut allowed restaurants and malls to reopen with significant limits. And New York allowed religious gatherings of up to 10 people.

archived recording (andrew cuomo) I understand their desire to get back to religious ceremonies as soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it. I think those religious ceremonies can be very comforting.

michael barbaro

But there were signs on Wednesday that the reopenings would be slow and risky. Ford, which restarted its U.S. assembly lines earlier this week, said it would halt operations at plants in Illinois and Michigan after workers there tested positive for the virus.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the coronavirus is killing black Americans at staggeringly higher rates than white Americans. My colleague, Times Magazine writer Linda Villarosa, on the myth of the pandemic as the great equalizer. It’s Wednesday, May 20.

linda villarosa Hello? nicole charles Hello. Hello? linda villarosa Hello. Hi, my name’s Linda Villarosa. I’m from The New York Times Magazine. nicole charles How are you, Miss Linda? linda villarosa I’m OK. How are you? nicole charles I’m just OK, too. linda villarosa Yeah. I think we should just accept that we’re, like, OK. And listen, I’m — I’ve been hearing stories about your husband all morning and, you know, wish I had gotten to meet him. What a wonderful person he sounds like. nicole charles Oh, yes he was. That’s what he was.

michael barbaro

Linda, tell me about Cornell Charles.

linda villarosa

Cornell Charles, who goes by the nickname Dickey, was born and raised in New Orleans. He still lived in the house where he grew up. He was a family man who had two daughters. He was married for decades to Nicole Charles, his wife, who I got to speak to recently.

nicole charles My husband loved to cook. Every Sunday my husband would cook — you would think he was cooking for the military.

linda villarosa

Dickey was the king of the kitchen. Every Sunday after church, friends and family gathered at Nicole and Dickey’s house.

nicole charles You didn’t have to have an invite to come in. Everybody knew it — I want to eat something, I’m going by Cornell and Nicole’s.

linda villarosa

People knew you could just go there. The door was open.

nicole charles He loved for you to gloat over his food. He wanted you to brag on it. So he would literally sit there and watch you eat it, and he was always like, “OK, how it taste? How it taste?” And everybody would be like, “Look at the plate. What does that tell you?” You know, so — linda villarosa And what were his best dishes? nicole charles Oh, my god, Miss Linda. His gumbo was number one. He was definitely a seafood boiler.

linda villarosa

He cooked seafood. He cooked gumbo.

nicole charles He also was a master of spaghetti salad.

linda villarosa

He also made meatballs.

nicole charles He would cook meatballs the size of a baseball. So everybody would call them miniature meatloaves, because they were so big.

linda villarosa

And as a community man, he was also part of this club called the Zulu Club.

linda villarosa Tell me about what the Zulu group meant to your husband. nicole charles It was — let met see how I can — it was in his blood. If I can — that kind of sums it up.

michael barbaro

And what is the Zulu Club?

linda villarosa

So the Zulu Club is an organization of mostly black men in New Orleans.

nicole charles He first got involved in Zulu in around 2004. My dad was Zulu governor that year. And my husband began to deal with Zulu.

linda villarosa

And it was started in 1909. Black people were still reeling from the end of slavery. And also, it was during the years of Jim Crow, when black people and other people couldn’t afford funerals. And so the Zulu Club members came together to pool their money together to bury their dead in a dignified manner.

nicole charles He was passionate about it. And he would give his all. Zulu was definitely something he enjoyed. It was a respectable organization of men.

linda villarosa

Most of the year, it’s a civic club. So they collect food. There’s scholarships, a mentoring program. But during Mardi Gras —

archived recording 1 All right. And now we are showing — archived recording 2 The King of Zulu. archived recording 3 — King Zulu, Ryan —

linda villarosa

It’s the symbol of black New Orleans. And it involves festivals, and balls, and all kinds of different events.

[band music]

linda villarosa

The event that Dickey Charles was the most involved with was the Governor’s Ball. And there were thousands of people at that event. It’s a party. People bring their own food. You have to wear formal clothes or else you can’t get in. People are elbow to elbow. They’re dancing. And it lasts all night. It’s really fun. But as this was happening, behind the scenes coronavirus was also building.

[parade sounds]

linda villarosa

So.

nicole charles He came home from work.

linda villarosa

10 days after Mardi Gras ended, Dickey Charles didn’t feel well.

nicole charles Then he said, “I feel like I’m coming down with something.” Which is normal for him. I said, well, OK. You know, why don’t you just take it easy? But he spiked a fever, like the next day. And I’m just thinking, he got the flu. So let’s give you some Tylenol and then put some fluids in you and — whatever, whatever. So two or three days of that went on with his flu spiking. And my husband is a big man. Even if he was sick, he would still eat. But I couldn’t even get him to eat soup, and that was his go-to thing when he was sick. So I said, “Baby, you have to put something in your stomach,” because he was a diabetic. He also had high blood pressure, and he also had kidney disease. Saturday morning, we wake up. Still. I said, “Baby, how you feel?” And he was just like, “Ah, you know, I’m — I feel faint.” And I said, “OK, I don’t like that. I said, go take a shower, put on some clothes. We’re going to the E.R.” So that was March 14.

linda villarosa

They checked him in to the hospital, and by the following day, it was clear that something was wrong.

nicole charles Sunday, when the medical doctor came in, she said, I want you to see the chest X-rays. So I said OK. She put it up on the screen. She said, “Well, you see where his left lung is clear?” Left lung is fine. She said, “But you see this little cloud over his right lung?” I said, yes, ma’am. She said, well, this could be pneumonia. But she said, “But I’m going to start him on some antibiotics. In case that’s what it is, I want to beat it.” In a matter of hours — in a matter of hours, they come back, and they tell me how bad his lungs are.

linda villarosa

And that was a clue that they needed to test him for the coronavirus, even though it would take 10 days for the results to come back.

nicole charles And one of the doctors came in and said, “We need to have a very honest conversation. We need to vent your husband now.” So of course my heart dropped. And I said, “A ventilator?” And he was like, “Yes, ma’am. His lungs will not be functioning much longer on their own.” linda villarosa Goodness. nicole charles I was like, he really is — my husband really is sick, which I didn’t realize it was to that extent. If they’re telling me he needs to be on a ventilator. I don’t want to say no and not give him a chance. Do you know what I’m saying? linda villarosa Mm-hmm. nicole charles So I’m like, OK. All right, let’s do it.

linda villarosa

So for the next three days, Nicole was at the hospital. Dickey’s on the ventilator. He was in a coma-like state, so he’s not responding.

nicole charles So — linda villarosa What were you saying to him? nicole charles Oh, my god, how much I love him. I miss him. You know, pray. I need you to pray. You know, I was telling him, “You may not can speak, but God can hear your prayer.” And that was basically my conversation for him every day in I.C.U. You know, and we would listen to gospel music. I would pray for him anyway. And I was in the midst of praying for him — which is what I did all the time. I would touch him from his head to his toe, and I would pray over his body. I was at his feet, and I was coming back up towards his head, and he opened his eyes for me. And I said, “Oh,” I said, “Baby, you opened your eyes for me.” I said, “I’m so proud of you.” And he knew I was there, because he would nod. Now, at this time I was playing gospel music, and the phone went off. And I said, “Do you want me to play another gospel song for you?” And he nodded his head. “Do you love me?” And he nodded his head. And I said, “I love you so much.” I said, “I’m so proud of you. You opened your eyes.” And he had his eyes open the whole time I was there. And the nurse who was working with him that day, she said, “Mr. Charles, I’ve been trying to get you to open your eyes all day, and you’re showing off for your wife.” And I said, “That’s right, because he had to look at his wife. He heard my voice, and he had to see my face.” And that was the last time I saw my husband with his eyes open. He looked good. My husband never lost weight. He never looked sick, Miss Linda. He never — even when he was on the ventilator, he never looked sick. He never looked sick. And I thank God for that. Because him looking sick and being sick probably would have really screwed me up. Looking at him looking healthy, and — and I — you know, I told him. I said, “I love you, and I’m leaving you in God’s hands.” I kept talking to him and just — telling him how much we loved him. And how much we’re going to miss him. And he took his last breath in front of me at 1:33 on the 24th. He looked really, really peaceful. He did. Yes.

linda villarosa

He died that afternoon. And he was only 51 years old.

[music]

linda villarosa

The next day, as Nicole was grieving, she finally got the results of Dickey’s Covid test and found out that, yes, he was positive. He did die of the coronavirus.

nicole charles The phone calls that I have gotten from Zulu members have been overwhelming. They have reached out via text, via phone call, sending cards. It’s just so much, you know Miss Linda, and I didn’t realize the magnitude of the people my husband touched until his passing. And I’ve gotten so many phone calls to tell me, you know, he motivated me to do this, or he encouraged me to do that, or he was my mentor. I mean, I can just stand so proud and say he was my husband. I can stand tall and just brag that that was my husband, you know what I mean? It’s so funny, because being his wife, and as much as he used to go — and when I say “go,” he went with a purpose. Baby, I’m going to — I’ve got to go practice this team at this time. I have to practice this team at that time. When I leave there, I have to go to this meeting, or whatever, whatever. And to realize what his purpose was now gives me such a sense of joy. archived recording Well, Since Mardi Gras Day, it has been a devastating couple of weeks for Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.

linda villarosa

But he wasn’t the only member of the Zulu Club to get sick.

archived recording Several of their members tested positive for coronavirus.

linda villarosa

At the time I finished my reporting, 30 members of the Zulu Club had been infected with the virus, and of those 30, eight had died.

michael barbaro

Wow.

linda villarosa

I looked at the Facebook page yesterday and saw that on May 4 another one of them died.

michael barbaro

Linda, what did you, and what did the members of the Zulu Club, make of the number of members who were dying?

linda villarosa

At first, it felt like, oh, wrong place, wrong time situation. Mardi Gras was really crowded. Carnival season lasted for six weeks. And there were crowds. People were elbow to elbow. So it made sense at the beginning. But, frankly, behind the scenes, those of us who understand public health or who look at questions of public health started to worry, because we knew that there were going to be high death rates among black people and high hospitalization rates. But there was no data yet. So when the data started rolling out —

archived recording Nationwide, cities have been releasing Covid-19 data showing racial disparities in diagnosis and in death.

linda villarosa

It confirmed what many in public health knew.

archived recording Those numbers show a disturbing trend.

linda villarosa

But it was still very scary.

archived recording Black people are dying at a much higher rate than any other race right now.

linda villarosa

In the state of Louisiana —

archived recording Of the more than 500 people whose final breaths were stolen by this disease, the state says that more than two thirds of them were black.

linda villarosa

Black people comprise 30 percent of the population but 70 percent of those who have died of Covid. Then other states started to roll out their data.

archived recording A thousand more cases of Covid-19 confirmed here in Illinois just today.

linda villarosa

In Illinois —

archived recording 1 More than half of all cases in Chicago are in the African-American community. archived recording 2 38 percent of Missourians who died from Covid-19 were black, but African-Americans only make up 12 percent of Missouri’s population. archived recording 3 The reports are startling — in North Carolina, Connecticut, and Michigan, too.

linda villarosa

So at that point, it begged the question why. Why was this killing so many black people? Why was it having such a devastating effect on black America?

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Linda, how do we explain this extraordinarily higher death rate in the black community from the coronavirus?

linda villarosa

Well, it was interesting. During the beginning of this pandemic —

archived recording (andrew cuomo) Everyone — everyone — is subject to this virus. It is the great equalizer.

linda villarosa

People started saying, oh, Covid is the great equalizer, or, the virus doesn’t discriminate.

archived recording From the moment the coronavirus outbreak began, health officials have preached that Covid-19 doesn’t discriminate, that it’s an equal opportunity killer.

linda villarosa

But those of us who have studied public health know that that wasn’t true. And in fact, we say it a different way. We say, when America sneezes the black community gets pneumonia. And for me, I’m really passionate about racial health disparities. I’ve been studying it for 30 years. I was a young editor at Essence magazine, and I started first writing about this. I’m writing a book about it now. And we have long known that all kinds of diseases do discriminate. It’s not equal.

michael barbaro

And how does Covid-19 discriminate against black America?

linda villarosa

Covid-19 is more serious in black Americans. So we’re more likely to be hospitalized, to have a serious case, and to also die from it. And there are three main reasons for this disparity.

michael barbaro

OK. And what is the first of those reasons?

linda villarosa

The first reason is simple. It’s proximity to the virus. Black Americans are more likely to be employed in essential jobs, in frontline jobs, in jobs where they are more commonly exposed to the virus itself. I’m thinking of Dickey Charles. He continued working. He was a courier for a medical company. I think of the Zulu members. One of the men who died was a postal worker. He was a mail carrier. One was a police officer who contracted Covid. Another was a security guard. And look, we don’t know whether these members of the Zulu Club contracted the virus at Mardi Gras or on their jobs. But we do know that the majority of black people in this country have jobs that put them at risk. So that’s the first reason black Americans are dying at such disproportionate rates. The second factor is discrimination that is embedded in the health care system itself.

michael barbaro

Linda, this is something you and I first talked about over a year ago when we did an episode of “The Daily” about black women and their mortality rates when giving birth. And you explained this concept that, essentially, racism — conscious or deeply unconscious — influences the kind of medical care delivered to black patients.

linda villarosa

Yes. And I believe that it’s unconscious. And it’s not just white doctors, it’s also black doctors we — or doctors of other races. Because we all live in this society that has discrimination and racist images embedded in our culture. It’s baked in. Thousands of studies have shown over decades that black people get unequal treatment in our health care system.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can walk me through a scenario that people in public health say could or has happened when it comes to this pandemic that explains this.

linda villarosa

Well, you can imagine being a health care provider, specifically being a physician, and you’re having to make life-or-death decisions — who should get tested? Who should be admitted to the hospital? Who needs to be put on a ventilator? Who needs to be taken off a ventilator? So you’re a doctor, and people that don’t look like you, don’t have the same culture as you, don’t have the same background with you come in, you may think about them differently. Medical providers don’t go into medicine to harm people, but that harm may show up, especially during a very stressed out moment, which is the essence of this moment and coronavirus.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, what is the third major factor here in why something like the coronavirus discriminates against black Americans?

linda villarosa

So the third reason is that black Americans have more of the underlying conditions that make Covid-19 worse. Some of these are hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and asthma. So if you have these underlying conditions, you’re more likely to be quite sick. That was the case with Dickey Charles. He had high blood pressure. He had diabetes. He had kidney disease. And that is also the case with so many other black Americans.

michael barbaro

And why is that? Why is there such a disproportionate level of these pre-existing underlying conditions?

linda villarosa

So at first glance, it seems like, well, if everyone just takes better care of themselves, you can avoid these kinds of conditions.

michael barbaro

Right.

linda villarosa

But that tilts toward a kind of irresponsibility among black people that really isn’t fair. So a study in early April found out that people who have been subjected to long term exposure to air pollution are more likely to have serious cases of Covid than people who don’t. And black people are more likely to live in areas that are polluted. New Orleans is part of “cancer alley,” which is an 85-mile stretch along the highway in Louisiana where there’s the largest concentration of petrochemical factories in the country. And so New Orleans itself is the victim of this kind of inequal exposure to dirty air, dirty water, dirty soil. And this is where the Zulus live. This is where Dickey Charles and Nicole Charles live. So the environment is one factor that drives the underlying conditions that black Americans are disproportionately more likely to face. But a second factor is the concept of weathering.

michael barbaro

And weathering is the concept that racism takes a physical toll on the black body and leaves it more vulnerable to all kinds of illness.

linda villarosa

That’s exactly right. And it’s best to think of it as a kind of accelerated aging. So adversity comes in the form of discrimination. It could be discrimination in housing. It could be discrimination by police. It could be discrimination in employment. It could just be the stress of having to struggle every day. It changes the systems of the body at a cellular level. So if you are faced with a kind of adverse event, your blood pressure goes up, your heart rate goes up, your breathing becomes more rapid. And this is all part of the fight-or-flight syndrome. But it shouldn’t be made to happen over and over and over again. But if you’re facing that kind of adversity, that’s what happens, and it wears away the body. It ages the body. So that would make sense why black people are more likely to have these kind of underlying conditions and why we get them at younger ages.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, putting all of this together, all these factors, you have a black population at a higher risk of exposure, just given the nature of their work; a population that already has higher rates of underlying conditions; on top of that, there is this weathering phenomenon that deepens those conditions, literally seems to age this already-not-well, vulnerable body; and finally, a medical system inclined to undertreat these people when they come in to a hospital or a doctor’s office.

linda villarosa

Yes. And that is what has created this perfect and terrible storm when it comes to the coronavirus and black people in America.

michael barbaro

Linda, it sounds like the public health experts you talked to, that they knew these death rates, these infection rates, this kind of disproportionateness, was going to play out with this pandemic. And now that it has, how are they thinking about it?

linda villarosa

I think this is a difficult moment, but it’s also a moment where a tragedy can be turned into something else. So those in public health have known that there are racial disparities in health. I mean, we’ve known since 1899 when W.E.B. Du Bois was calling it a crisis. And some of the people that I interviewed in my story have been studying this for decades and have added up the price. And so they’re hoping that now is a moment of reckoning to say, this is a horrible moment, please don’t turn away. Do something about this.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what the government’s response to this pandemic, which is widely acknowledged, was slow, what that has meant for this particular group of Americans.

linda villarosa

So the government’s slow and uncoordinated and confusing response hurt everyone. It hurt all Americans. It harmed us. But it hurt this group — black people, black Americans — worse. Because we were already more vulnerable to many of these health problems that make Covid-19 worse. And sometimes when I think of it, I think specifically about the men in the Zulu Club and how they were harmed by this federal response. And it had this terrible sad trickle-down effect to them on the ground.

michael barbaro

Right. Well, how are members of the Zulu Club and their families doing at this point?

linda villarosa

The entire group is reeling from what happened. I mean, they’re a brotherhood, so they’re trying to support and take care of each other. But they’re in pain.

linda villarosa And you’re good? You’re feeling OK?

linda villarosa

I also checked in with Nicole, Dickey Charles’s wife, just to see how she was doing.

nicole charles I’m feeling as good as I can be. God didn’t choose me, so I have to find a way to maneuver my new life.

linda villarosa

This is a very hard time for her. She’s grieving this man that she was married to for three decades.

nicole charles But it’s going to be a huge, huge adjustment. I tell people my life did a 180-degree turn within a matter of 10 days, you know. linda villarosa Yeah. nicole charles And I sorely miss my husband. Out of 30 years, Miss Linda, I’ve never not slept next to him for longer than two days. In 30 years. linda villarosa Oh, wow. nicole charles If I did not sleep next to him, he was going to a football camp —

[music]

linda villarosa

More than a week after Dickey Charles died, she arranged his funeral. It was at their church. There were 10 people there — 10 family members and an organist.

archived recording (SINGING) I feel trust in the Lord. I feel —

linda villarosa

It was also live streamed. Six hundred people tuned in. I tuned in.

archived recording (SINGING) Oh, I feel trust in the Lord.

linda villarosa

I found it sad and hard, because I was thinking about someone like Dickey and many of the other Zulus would have gotten a different kind of sendoff. Would have gotten a second line funeral, where, you know, it happens in the street, and all those 600 people would be right there in person. People would be dressed up. There would be music. And that is the legacy of the Zulu Club. It was formed to help people send off their dead in a graceful, in a respectful, in a dignified way, and in a way that celebrated their life.

michael barbaro

Linda, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

Thank you. And please take care of yourself.

You, too.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has fired the inspector general for the Department of State, whose investigation posed a threat to his administration. Maggie Haberman on the pattern that that reveals. It’s Tuesday, May 19. Maggie, where does the idea of an inspector general come from?

maggie haberman

So the idea of inspectors general, who are basically public watchdogs, emerged out of the Watergate era.

archived recording (richard nixon) I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.

maggie haberman

Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace after abusing his office.

archived recording (richard nixon) As president, I must put the interests of America first.

maggie haberman

Faith in government dipped substantially among the public.

archived recording (richard nixon) By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing, which is so desperately needed in America.

[music]

maggie haberman

And this idea came about of permanent government oversight at each federal agency of the executive branch, and each one would have their own watchdog in place. And they are supposed to do audits of operations. They’re investigating reports of waste or fraud or abuse. These oversight officers were essentially a bulwark against corruption, a bulwark against the type of abuses that took place during the Nixon era.

michael barbaro

So a kind of internal affairs department inside each agency of the executive branch?

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. Inside each agency of the executive branch was somebody who people could report tips to. And the I.G. could then investigate those and decide whether those were substantiated or not substantiated. And if they decide that there is something real there, they would immediately notify Congress within a week, within seven days. And so there is supposed to be this chain of accountability that exists with the I.G.s.

michael barbaro

And the final chain is Congress, so an entirely different branch of government.

maggie haberman

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And how are these inspectors general regarded after this law is passed?

maggie haberman

They are very respected. What was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch. And over the years, they have launched investigations into —

archived recording Strippers, casinos, Las Vegas — it sounds like a wild bachelor party, but instead, it’s Pentagon employees using their government-issued credit cards.

maggie haberman

Wasteful spending into fraud.

archived recording A new report by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security finds the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, or CIS, improperly granted citizenship —

maggie haberman

Into conflicts of interest, into abuse.

archived recording The Justice Department released details of a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report detailing chilling interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.

maggie haberman

And for the most part, presidents choose not to tangle with them. There are some notable exceptions. Ronald Reagan, for instance, replaced all of the inspectors general on day one. He said that he wanted a clean slate.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

George W. Bush raised some eyebrows with how he handled a NASA inspector general, for instance. And then we get to 2009. President Obama had been in office for only a handful of months. And at that point, he abruptly fires the inspector general, Gerald Walpin.

archived recording Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin. He is the inspector general of the Corporation and National Community Service. That is the federal agency responsible for distributing money to organizations like Americorps —

maggie haberman

Who was overseeing investigations into Americorps and other national service programs and how money was being spent on them.

archived recording He was investigating a close political pal of President Obama’s, but —

maggie haberman

And one of the people who Walpin was investigating was the Sacramento mayor and a former N.B.A. basketball star, Kevin Johnson. He was an Obama supporter, and the fact that there was a connection between the president and this person, who is connected to one of the groups that Walpin was looking at, raised a lot of eyebrows.

archived recording (gerald walpin) Well, actually, I was fired, because I was doing my job and doing it well and supporting my staff, who are —

maggie haberman

And President Obama alerted Congress that he had lost confidence in Walpin and was going to remove him from that position.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

[music]

And did he say why he lost confidence?

maggie haberman

He did not get into why he had lost confidence. He didn’t really offer any full explanation.

archived recording (chuck grassley) What we have here is a bigger problem with inspector generals that we got to watch this administration on.

maggie haberman

And at the time, Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, who has been very, very assiduous in his support for the I.G.s, was disturbed by what took place.

archived recording (chuck grassley) And I use inspector generals tremendously in my oversight work, so I’m going to fight hard to make sure they maintain their independence.

maggie haberman

He said at the time that he thought it looked as if Walpin had been doing a good job, that he had identified a lot of money in America funds that had not been used properly.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

The criticism of this move by Obama, it should be remembered, was not just Republicans. Claire McCaskill, senator from Missouri, who was an Obama supporter, was very critical of Walpin’s firing at the time. And this was the last time that Obama did this.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so lesson learned. Don’t mess with inspector generals.

maggie haberman

Right, or lesson certainly appeared to have been learned. It was, it was a hot stove that he touched, and he never touched it again.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

But from there, we got to President Trump, who, throughout his term, has been extremely skeptical of inspectors general.

michael barbaro

Why?

maggie haberman

He’s a business guy, Michael. He has never been in government before. And the idea of having this in-house adversarial relationship, somebody who works for him but who is there to tell him that he’s doing things wrong, is just a concept that’s anathema to him. And so he has chafed at it and has found it uncomfortable, to put it mildly. And then when they had started to do things that upset him, he becomes very angry. And that is what has led us to this unprecedented moment of, in the last two months, the president waging open war on the inspectors general.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Maggie, tell us about this unprecedented war that President Trump is waging on these inspectors general.

maggie haberman

So there have been four inspectors general who he has targeted. And in each case, he has felt some level of threat from each of them it seems. Michael Atkinson was the first one, and what’s important about Atkinson is he is the person who received a whistleblower complaint from an official in the intelligence community, who was detailed to the White House. And this complaint accused the president of an abuse of power related to foreign policy to force Ukraine’s government into announcing investigations related to Joe Biden and his son, that could have personal political benefit for the president. Atkinson found that complaint to be credible enough to have raised a, quote unquote, “urgent concern.” And it, under that label, had to be disclosed to Congress. And this report from Atkinson is what triggered the impeachment inquiry into the president. The president, last fall — before there were actual hearings related to the impeachment, but while Congress was starting to look at this — the president talked to his advisors about firing Michael Atkinson at the time. The president’s advisers told him this was a really bad idea. That if he did this, he was just throwing gasoline on an existing fire. So he waited, and the president was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial on February 5. And he dismissed Atkinson a handful of weeks later.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what does the president say when he fires Atkinson? Does he acknowledge that it appears to be an act of retribution for Atkinson’s role in the impeachment?

maggie haberman

No, the president does not acknowledge that at all.

archived recording (donald trump) I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.

maggie haberman

He says that he has lost confidence in Atkinson, and he says this in a letter to Congress.

archived recording (donald trump) He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.

maggie haberman

That was as much of a reason as Congress was getting.

archived recording (donald trump) That man is a disgrace to I.G.s. All right, let’s go.

michael barbaro

And I guess as much of a reason as the president needed to give Congress.

maggie haberman

All that he needed to say, and the way that he described it in his letter to Congress was, “As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general.” That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general. That’s as much as they got.

michael barbaro

And Maggie, what is the reaction in Congress, and I guess beyond Congress, to this firing of this inspector general?

maggie haberman

There was a large outcry.

archived recording (adam schiff) — course, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and what is this president doing as thousands of people are dying? He is retaliating against people that are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night. archived recording Listen, he got fired for political reasons. He got fired because the president believes that a deep state exists, a group of civil servants that are out to get him. That is not true.

maggie haberman

Democrats and even some Republicans said they were enormously troubled by what appeared to be an act of political retribution. But there was no consequence for this president. He’s right. It’s within his power of appointment as president. So he did it again a couple weeks later with another I.G.

michael barbaro

And who the second inspector general who was targeted by the president?

maggie haberman

Next up was Glenn Fine, who had been the acting inspector general for the Department of Defense since prior to President Trump took office. Now Michael, what was notable about Fine was that was about to become the chairman of a new committee that was going to do oversight on the spending in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This was going to be oversight of $2.2 trillion in coronavirus relief.

michael barbaro

So he was going to make sure that money was being properly spent. He was going to account for it.

maggie haberman

That’s right. Fine was going to be the watchdog for this massive amount of government spending. The president abruptly moved him out of his office, and therefore he couldn’t be the chairman of that committee. It seemed as if the president wanted to move out somebody who didn’t report directly to him or who was not promoted by him and not handpicked by him in the first place. That he wanted somebody who more fit that bill to sit on that committee that would be overseeing the spending of this $2.2 trillion.

[music]

Next on the list was the principal deputy inspector for the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm. She had done a report that was based on a number of interviews with hospitals all over the country, and those pinpointed massive shortages of supplies at various medical centers, efforts and struggles to obtain test kits, gear for hospital workers, ventilators that we’ve heard so much about since.

archived recording Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today, a survey, of more than 300 —

maggie haberman

The president was really unhappy about this report. What he said to reporters at the time was, it’s just wrong.

archived recording (reporter) I mean a week or longer. archived recording (donald trump) It’s just wrong. Did I hear the word “inspector general“? Really? It’s wrong, and they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.

maggie haberman

Many asked about who had written the report.

archived recording (donald trump) Well, where did it come from? The inspector general. What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) It came from the inspector general report — archived recording (donald trump) No, what’s his name? What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) I don’t know his name off the top of my head. archived recording (donald trump) Well, find me his name. Let me know, OK? If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it. archived recording But sir —

michael barbaro

He’s asking reporters for the name of the inspector general who has done something that has upset him.

maggie haberman

He was asking reporters to figure out for him — and he was assuming it was a male, it was a woman — who had written this report. Three weeks after Christi Grimm wrote this report, President Trump announced her replacement.

michael barbaro

OK, so that brings us, I believe, to inspector general number four. What is the story there?

maggie haberman

Inspector general number four, Steve Linick, had, according to Democratic congressional aides, opened up an inquiry into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife. And whether they were misusing a political appointee at the State Department to serve them, essentially — to perform menial duties like walking their dog, making restaurant reservations, picking up dry cleaning. And at the same time, Linick had been looking into, and was close to finishing, an investigation into Pompeo’s decision to go around Congress with an emergency declaration to approve billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year. There was an enormous outcry in Congress that this did not go through approval by congressional officials at the time. And Linick was looking into this.

michael barbaro

So the issue here is whether or not the State Department kind of created a false sense of urgency around approving an arms sale to the Saudi Arabian government.

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. And that report, as I said, was close to completion. So these two investigations were going on, and we are told that Mike Pompeo told the president that he thought that Linick should be fired. So on Friday, that’s exactly what happened. Another late Friday night ousting of an inspector general, Linick was announced as departed.

michael barbaro

What has been the reaction to this firing?

maggie haberman

Democrats are very upset about this.

archived recording (robert menendez) We need to know why an inspector general all of a sudden gets sacked on a Friday night, added to the three other I.G.s that have been sacked. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The fact is if it looks like it’s in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing, that could be unlawful.

maggie haberman

But given what’s happening with coronavirus, given that the attention of the country is largely on either the deaths caused by the virus or the economic devastation caused by the response to dealing with the virus, this has not broken through in the way that it might in any other moment in time.

michael barbaro

Hmm, how are Republicans reacting to this ouster?

maggie haberman

With the exception of some concern from Chuck Grassley, who’s been consistent about inspectors general, and Mitt Romney, who was very critical and who was the only Republican vote in favor of impeachment against President Trump, there has been radio silence from Republicans on this.

michael barbaro

It feels like the events of the past few months reveal a pretty central flaw in the original creation of the inspectors general, which is that it allows the president to fire these independent figures, right? I mean it’s interesting that it was created in the aftermath of Watergate as a check against bad actions in government. And yet, Watergate was all about a president being abusive, and here you have a law that allows a president to fire those internal watchdogs.

maggie haberman

Michael, I think you’ve identified the exact problem with this law, which is that it’s only as good as the honor system around it. Because if it’s just another piece of the president’s power, if the president isn’t going to abide by what these inspectors general find and let them do their investigations, then it’s not worth very much.

michael barbaro

So the political consequences for the president are, at this point, uncertain for removing these inspector generals. But I’m curious what you think the consequences are for the inspector generals who remain throughout the executive branch. I mean will this affect how they do their job?

maggie haberman

Michael, I think that we’re never going to know for certain most likely, but I could see scenarios where inspectors general feel like they can’t open an investigation, because if they do, it’s just going to get shut down. Or they get pieces of information, and they want additional confirmation before they’ll pursue something. It could absolutely have a chilling effect on how these folks do their jobs.

[music]

michael barbaro

Have any of these fired or dismissed inspectors general spoken out since they lost their jobs?

maggie haberman

There was a really remarkable statement that Michael Atkinson, the dismissed intelligence community inspector general, put out. And he defined this as a message he was leaving for, quote, “any government employee or contractor who believes they have learned of or observed unethical, wasteful or illegal behavior in the federal government.” And he had a very dramatic line in it, talking about the significance of his office: “The American people deserve an honest and effective government. They are counting on you to use authorized channels to bravely speak up. There is no disgrace in doing so.” And then he goes on to talk about the importance of whistleblower programs and says, “Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.”

[music]

michael barbaro

Maggie, thank you very much.

maggie haberman

Michael, thank you.

michael barbaro

On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in an interview that he had asked President Trump to fire the inspector general of the State Department, but said that it was not an act of retaliation. Democrats remain skeptical. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent President Trump a letter demanding a detailed explanation for the firing. In the letter, Pelosi called it, quote, “part of a pattern of undermining the integrity of the inspectors general and therefore our government.” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (alex azar) We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control. There was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.

michael barbaro

In a speech at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pointedly criticized the group, saying it had mishandled the original outbreak of the virus in China by promoting misinformation from the government there.

archived recording (alex azar) The status quo is intolerable. W.H.O. must change, and it must become far more transparent and far more accountable.

michael barbaro

At the meeting, leaders of the World Health Organization said that they would review their response to the pandemic, something that several member countries, including the U.S. have demanded. And —

archived recording (donald trump) Yeah, I’ve taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here.

michael barbaro

During a news conference on Monday, President Trump said that he has been taking doses of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the virus, despite a lack of evidence that it works.

archived recording Can you explain, sir, though, what is the evidence that it has a preventative effect? archived recording (donald trump) Here we go. You ready? Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it. The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA with, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it, and we’ve done a great —

michael barbaro

The Times reports that the president’s disclosure has alarmed doctors, who fear it may encourage Americans to use the drug. The Food and Drug Administration has previously issued a safety warning about the medicine, saying that it can cause serious heart problems and should not be used outside of hospitals or clinical trials.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: Saving the U.S. economy from the fallout of the pandemic may require a historic infusion of cash. Ben Castleman on the debate over that spending. Its Monday, May 18. Ben, we’re talking to you on Friday morning, and a bunch of big, ugly, economic numbers just came out this morning. So we wanted to sift through them with you.

ben castleman

Yeah. It’s been a pretty dark morning for the economy.

michael barbaro

Where do you think we should start?

ben castleman

Maybe the place to start is actually on Thursday.

archived recording We turn now to the economy. Nearly 3 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.

ben castleman

When we learned that another 3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.

archived recording That’s more than 36 million people in two months.

ben castleman

We’re two months into this crisis, and yet we are still losing millions of jobs every week.

archived recording For eight straight weeks now, jobless claims have been in the millions with 3 million more people filing for unemployment last week.

michael barbaro

Right. Every week.

ben castleman

Every week.

archived recording This did not happen naturally. All of these companies didn’t just go out of business because demand disappeared. We turned our economy off. Right? Think about New York. Think about the state of California. If you ran a restaurant, a mini golf course, or a clothing store, there’s a really good chance you would have laid your workers off.

ben castleman

And then, Friday morning, we get up.

archived recording It’s the services industries that are getting crushed here.

ben castleman

And we learn that retail sales in April were down more than 16 percent. That’s by far the worst that we’ve ever seen.

archived recording But as far as these retail sales go, worse than expected month over month.

ben castleman

Over the last two months, restaurants lost half their business. Apparel and clothing stores have lost nearly 90 percent of their business.

archived recording The country’s shut down, and people aren’t buying stuff. I hate to state the obvious, but they’re not buying cars, down 12 percent. They’re not buying furnishings and home furnishing items, down 58 percent. Clothing and clothing accessories, down 78 percent.

ben castleman

And then we got another data point that said that industrial production, right, this is the actual stuff that we make in the economy, was down by the most in more than a century that we’ve been keeping records, meaning worse than the Great Depression.

michael barbaro

In other words, as bad as it gets.

ben castleman

As bad as it has ever gotten. We know that this is deep. We know that it is broad-based. We don’t yet know how long it will last. And that’s the fundamental question going forward.

michael barbaro

So given all that, I want to turn to a speech.

archived recording Good morning. It’s my pleasure and privilege to welcome back Chair Jay Powell.

michael barbaro

That the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, made a couple of days ago, that I think speaks to all this data.

ben castleman

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve doesn’t make a ton of speeches, so I know that his words carry a lot of weight.

ben castleman

Yeah. So Jerome Powell comes out.

archived recording (jerome powell) The coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake.

ben castleman

Of course, he’s giving the speech remotely, so he’s in front of these blue curtains — or maybe they’re digitally superimposed blue curtains, I’m not actually sure — on a Zoom-style call. But he comes out with this really stark message.

archived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent.

ben castleman

And he’s saying, this economic crisis is incredibly deep.

archived recording (jerome powell) We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment.

ben castleman

It’s incredibly broad.

archived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.

ben castleman

And it is hitting the most vulnerable workers more than anyone. He has this line early in the speech where he says —

archived recording (jerome powell) While we’re all affected.

ben castleman

“While we are all affected” —

archived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.

ben castleman

— “The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.”

archived recording (jerome powell) Among people who were working in February, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year, had lost a job in March.

ben castleman

Lower income Americans, black Americans, less educated Americans.

archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.

michael barbaro

And Ben Powell talks about this specter of permanent economic damage in this speech, and perhaps he was referring most urgently to these lower income workers. But I want to understand that concept, because it feels a little bit new to me. I think of almost all economic conditions as temporary. So what did he mean by that?

ben castleman

You’re right to think about most economic conditions as temporary, because historically, that is the way economists have thought about recessions and economic downturns — is some people lose their jobs, and then they get those jobs back when things get better. Some businesses lose business, or maybe they go out of business, but other things come back up and replace them. But we’ve learned over time that that is not the way recessions always work, and especially long and deep recessions. That when people lose their jobs, if they’re out of work for too long, they can drift away from the labor market. They can lose their connections, and all of a sudden, even when the economy starts to get better, it’s very hard for them to get back to work.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can give me an example of this to bring it to life.

ben castleman

Well, imagine a small company, right, that maybe somebody has spent their lives, maybe a couple generations building. You could imagine if this crisis were to last a few weeks, they lose some revenue, they take a hit, but they start right back up where they left off. But as this drags on and they fall behind on loans, you fall behind on your rent payments, and all of a sudden, you can get to a place where you can’t reopen that business, where you can’t restart. And sure, the business owner might be able to go and find another job, but that business is lost forever.

michael barbaro

And so that is what Powell is referring to when he talks about permanent economic damage from this pandemic.

ben castleman

That’s what Powell fears, and that’s what he wants to make sure we avoid.

michael barbaro

What kind of solution, what kind of plan does he have in mind in this speech to avoid permanent economic damage?

ben castleman

Well, Powell starts by talking about all the things that we have already done, and he’s full of praise for that.

archived recording (jerome powell) The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful.

ben castleman

He talks about what the Fed itself has done, of course, but he also talks about —

archived recording (jerome powell) To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion.

ben castleman

— what Congress has done, the nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending that Congress has approved.

archived recording (jerome powell) For households, businesses, health care providers and state and local governments.

ben castleman

And there are a lot of programs that Congress has enacted to try to deal with this, right? They’ve written checks to virtually every American. They’ve offered loans and grants to businesses, and Powell says that all of those things have been incredibly important to softening the blow of this crisis.

archived recording (jerome powell) The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability and will provide some support to the recovery, when it comes.

ben castleman

But then, he says —

archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well.

ben castleman

— basically, we’re not done yet.

michael barbaro

That that was not enough.

ben castleman

That it probably won’t be enough. That we know now that this is not a crisis that is going to last for just a month or just a couple of months. It’s going to drag on. And that as it drags on, if the government doesn’t step in and do enough to keep people and businesses afloat, then we’re going to see a lot more of that kind of permanent damage that Powell is talking about.

michael barbaro

And when he suggests that we aren’t done yet, what is he really saying?

ben castleman

What he’s really saying is to Congress, you need to keep spending. The Fed will do what it can do, but the Fed can only lend money. It’s Congress that has the ability to spend money, to give money to people, to give money to businesses. And that is, in all likelihood, what it will take to get through this period. He describes what’s been done so far as a bridge, a bridge across temporary interruptions, he says. And what he’s basically saying is the bridge doesn’t yet reach all the way across the river. And a bridge doesn’t do you much good if it stops when you’re still over water.

michael barbaro

No. It does not. Is that normal for the chairman of the Fed to do this, to be advising Congress to spend a lot more money in this manner?

ben castleman

Not in as direct terms as this. But this was, at least by the standards of Fed chairs, a pretty direct call to action.

archived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it, if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This trade-off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers of taxation and spending.

michael barbaro

And can we safely assume that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve tells Congress, this is what I think you should do, that he assumes that that is what Congress will do?

ben castleman

Oh, I don’t think we should assume that Powell thinks that Congress will do it. But I think Powell knew that he was speaking at a moment when there’s a major political debate that’s playing out between Democrats and Republicans about what the role of government is in this crisis. And he’s, in effect, weighing in on one side of that debate, but I don’t think he’s under any illusion that he alone will resolve it.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Ben, describe the divisions between Democrats and Republicans in Congress about this advice from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

ben castleman

Well, think back for a moment to those trillions of dollars in spending that have already taken place.

archived recording (charles grassley) I want to highlight a few areas of bipartisan economic relief we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their families.

ben castleman

When Congress approved those measures, it was really bipartisan.

michael barbaro

Right.

archived recording (chuck schumer) This is a strange and evil disease. There is much we still don’t know about it, and it is keeping us apart.

ben castleman

But that came at a moment when the economy was in the process of shutting down, and there was pretty widespread agreement that that had to happen.

archived recording (chuck schumer) When we passed this bill, instead of hugging each other, we’ll wave from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations through America’s darkest hours.

ben castleman

We’re now in a very different moment.

archived recording Democratic leader. archived recording (chuck schumer) Well, it’s been two weeks since Leader McConnell called us back into session.

ben castleman

Where there are real divisions between Republicans and Democrats about how quickly reopening should take place.

archived recording (chuck schumer) In that time, it was announced that 30 million Americans filed for unemployment. And yet the Republican leader has scheduled exactly zero votes, zero, on legislation related to the coronavirus crisis.

ben castleman

And with that comes real disagreement about the role of the federal government in continuing to support businesses and especially workers.

archived recording (chuck schumer) Let’s solve the problem right now. What are we going to do for people who are out of work?

ben castleman

The Democrats are by and large saying, much of the country is still shut down.

archived recording (chuck schumer) What are we going to do for businesses that are going under?

ben castleman

And so the government has to continue to support workers and businesses. It has to keep on spending. The Republican side is a little more complicated.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) This emergency is very serious. So the Senate’s response has been serious.

ben castleman

It’s not unanimous, but there is certainly, at least in Congress, more of an inclination to say —

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, here in the real world, Senate Republicans are working seriously to help the country reopen.

ben castleman

Let’s see how this reopening process goes. Let’s see if the businesses reopen, and if they do, maybe we don’t need to do very much more. And if they don’t come back and there’s a need for further action, then we can talk about that then.

michael barbaro

So it’s a bit more of a wait and see whether Congress really needs to spend all that much more money.

ben castleman

That’s right, and that question of spending is what’s hanging over this. The Republicans are looking at the trillions, with a T, that have been spent so far and saying, can we wait to spend more?

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) The crushing unemployment figures show us that no amount of federal spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more sustainable middle ground.

michael barbaro

Ben, how tied are these different approaches to the long-standing economic ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties?

ben castleman

Well, look, Republicans have a long-standing discomfort with programs like unemployment insurance.

archived recording (john coryn) At a certain point, these benefits are going to do more harm than good, and I would say they already are starting to do that. So extending unemployment benefits through next year would deter people from trying to return to work, because why would they? Why would someone choose to do more work for less money?

ben castleman

So it’s not surprising that as we move from the acute phase of this crisis into the long, slow recovery, that Republicans would be the first to start raising questions about the spending and to start thinking about pulling back on some of those programs.

archived recording (john coryn) So we’re already looking at staggering debt that we are going to have to deal with at some point, because it’s immoral to expect our kids and grandkids to pay that money back after we’ve already cashed those checks.

ben castleman

Democrats have long advocated for more generous unemployment benefits, for a larger role for government, and so it’s not too surprising that they are more comfortable with these programs lasting longer.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of this problem and understands that the approach to it is to get money down into the hands of the people who will put it down at the grassroots level and help support this economy from the ground up.

michael barbaro

And so this is the long-standing, very inflexible ideological terrain that Powell is entering when he goes to Congress and says, hey, cough up trillions of dollars more.

ben castleman

That’s right.

michael barbaro

But it feels like in this debate, the real anxiety is over just the enormity of the scale of money that we’re talking about. And I feel at this point, I have to ask you the question that we all pretend to know the answer to, which is: Where does all this money come from that Powell is suggesting Congress spend and that Democrats and Republicans are not really agreeing on whether to spend?

ben castleman

In the simplest terms, we’re borrowing it. The congressional budget office projects that the deficit this year will be $3.7 trillion.

michael barbaro

And we’re borrowing those trillions of dollars from whom?

ben castleman

So Congress decides how much it’s going to spend, and it of course sets tax rates as well. And any time that Congress decides to spend more than it brings in in tax rates, then the Treasury Department has to sell bonds to make up the difference. And that just means that it’s asking people, investors, foreign governments to lend the United States money. You give us money now, we’ll give you money back with a small amount of interest in anywhere from a few days to 10 years.

michael barbaro

Right. So when we hear about treasury bonds and their yields, that is the interest payment that the U.S. government is giving to someone who buys a treasury bond, and then the process has lent money to the U.S. and to Congress.

ben castleman

That’s right. Every time the government sells a bond, it’s borrowing money from the public. It’s paying some interest on that, just like if you borrowed money to buy a house or to make a purchase, to buy a car. The only difference is the federal government gets a much better interest rate than you or I ever will.

michael barbaro

So we kind of become the bank.

ben castleman

We become the bank.

michael barbaro

And to hear someone like Jerome Powell describe it, that doesn’t seem all that risky for Congress to spend all that money, which would require the U.S. borrowing that much from us and anyone who wants to buy U.S. treasury bonds. But is it risky?

ben castleman

So in the short term, there’s really no risk here. We can keep borrowing, as long as people will keep lending us money. In the long term, of course, we have to make good on those loans.

michael barbaro

Right.

ben castleman

And we have to pay interest on those loans. And so there will certainly be a debate when we come out the other side of this crisis about what the government should do about these huge deficits. But that debate is still years away. Because we’re at a very particular moment right now, which is that we’re in the middle of an immediate crisis. And if we don’t get our economy back on track, then none of that longer run debate matters. That debate is conditional on having an economy at all on the other side of this.

michael barbaro

Right. So you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all.

ben castleman

Yeah. Powell is saying, the debt is the least of our worries right now. It’s not that it doesn’t matter. It’s not that it will never matter. But we have to try to get the economy through this period and moving again, before we can worry about any of those other long-run concerns. You could think about it like performing CPR. Right? Performing CPR often involves breaking ribs, and that’s a real consequence. But that doesn’t mean you don’t perform CPR. You perform CPR, you try to get somebody whose heart started again, and then you worry about the other consequences once the person’s heart is beating again.

michael barbaro

And just to be clear, in this metaphor the broken ribs is massive U.S. debt spending on stimulus.

ben castleman

And the heart is the American economy, which right now is stopped and which we somehow have to get beating again. And so what you now have is Powell and lots of other economists who, like him, would normally be worried about the debt who are saying, now is not the moment. That includes people who were advisers to George W. Bush, people who were advisers to Republican candidates and Republican leaders throughout the last several decades. Pretty much all of the economists that I talk to and that my colleagues have been talking to are saying the same thing, which is now is not the moment to worry about the debt.

michael barbaro

So if this is the broad consensus of economists across the United States, Ben, why is this much of a debate in Congress at all?

ben castleman

Economists like to think that they issue these sage pieces of advice, and everybody on Capitol Hill and in statehouses will rush to follow them. But of course, that’s not the way the world works.

michael barbaro

And so it may well be the case that many members of Congress thank the Federal Reserve chairman but say, you know, we’re not going to follow that advice.

ben castleman

And we’ve already heard Republicans in Congress saying exactly that.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, we can’t spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again, consistent with the guidelines that have been laid down by the health care professionals toward opening up the economy. It’s the only solution to the dilemma with which we are confronted.

ben castleman

They just don’t believe that what Powell is saying right now is the real solution to our economic problems, even though many of their own economic advisers are telling them the same thing.

[music]

michael barbaro

Ben, thank you very much.

ben castleman

michael barbaro

In his commencement speeches, former President Barack Obama delivered pointed criticism of how the U.S. government has handled the pandemic.

archived recording (barack obama) More than anything, this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.

michael barbaro

Obama did not mention President Trump by name, but his remarks were seen as a clear indictment of his successor.

archived recording (barack obama) All those adults that used to think they were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out, they don’t have all the answers. A lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions. So if the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you.

Because I have a very sedentary job even by sedentary job standards, I like to do squats in my chair. I will just lift myself up. People at home won’t see this, but I literally like to — just every once in a while, this yogic squat is very — malasana, I think they call it. This is just really good for your legs every hour or something like that.

[music]

Hi, I’m James Poniewozik, and I’m a TV critic for The New York Times. Other than the fear of death and social collapse and economic catastrophe, the day-to-day of my life has not really changed that much. I always work from home. This thing that everybody is dealing with now — you know, how do I keep myself from going insane if I don’t go outside — that’s been my life for years. We’re all kind of stay-at-home TV critics now. Welcome to my world, America. Particularly as a TV critic, I’m very attuned to the fact that there is a lot of language of shame that is built around our consumption of TV. People who watch TV are couch potatoes. And there might be a feeling that if you’re quarantined inside and watching six episodes of something on Netflix, that you’re doing something shameful and unproductive. And I am here to tell you, as a professional TV watcher, that you should not feel ashamed. Consuming entertainment, experiencing good or even brilliantly dumb art is a form of self-care. It is something salutary that you are doing for your brain. To help your brain deal with the often painful process of living in the world in this really crazy time. Art, whether it is a marble statue or a network sitcom, is human beings trying to express something that they can’t express in literal language, and how to process all of the overwhelming things that humans have to deal with. Honestly, that was probably a big aspect of my childhood. I think my parents and I often communicated with each other more through the shows we were watching at the same time than through things that we directly said to each other.

[m*a*s*h theme music]

I remember watching M*A*S*H during the afternoon and the early evening, when it would rerun, with my dad. My dad drove a beer and liquor delivery truck. He was a Teamster, which was a very physically punishing job. Like, he destroyed his back and his knees. And so when he would come home, he would — for some reason this felt good to him — would lie down on the living room floor in front of the TV. And my memory of watching M*A*S*H is me on the living room couch and my dad in front of me, maybe propped up on one arm on the floor, watching the TV sort of at my feet.

So right now it’s my wife and I, and we have two kids at home. My younger son’s in high school. My older son is in his first year of college and is now around the house. And —

[""survivor"" theme music]

— we’re not really a sports family. But “Survivor,” it’s our competition. There is a great deal of meta “Survivor” analysis that occupies much of the time in our household.

james poniewozik

I tend to get shushed a lot while we’re watching “Survivor.”

james poniewozik

Because I make comments or have questions for my son, the “Survivor” expert —

And I’m in trouble, and I am reminded that watching “Survivor” is a privilege and not a right.

archived recording I took myself out of this game!

james poniewozik

I’ve been watching “Bob’s Burgers.” That’s the show that just Andre and I — my younger son and I — watch together. My wife is not particularly into the show. My older son can take it or leave it. So that will be if everybody else has gone to bed or is doing something else. And we do have a little dance that we do sitting on the couch. There’s the theme song. It’s on I think ukulele.

[""bob's burgers"" theme music]

Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. And there’s this, like, percussion thing. Boom! And we lean into each other and bump shoulders. Boom! Back the other way. Boom! And bump shoulders again. Just us.

james poniewozik

What are some of other regular shows? My older son, who’s a music major in college, he was able to airdrum, beginning to end, all the percussion moments in the “Friday Night Lights” theme song.

[""friday night lights"" theme music]

He had all these gestures that I can’t reproduce or whatever. This is one of the most beautiful shows ever made for television that’s not just about football.

james poniewozik

I can’t change the fact that every human on earth has a real existential problem right now. And I can’t change how, even some of the shows that I love and that simply entertained me before are now, in many ways, painful reminders. But I can deal with them, and make it a little easier to tolerate, and even enjoy getting through it, through the people that I watch with and through the rituals that we have of watching. Sharing TV with people you love, whether they’re with you or on the other end of a Zoom chat, can be a really valuable way to get through this.

tejal rao

Hi, I’m Tejal Rao. I’m the California restaurant critic for The New York Times, and I’m also a columnist for The New York Times Magazine. Well, it’s been really strange, because there isn’t much use for restaurant criticism right now. The restaurant industry is suffering, and so many restaurant workers are out of work. And I’m really, really worried. I’m really missing going out to restaurants and being in public spaces, and the luxury of other people cooking for me. And I’m cooking a lot at home, but I’m also doing this really slightly strange thing, which is rewatching food scenes in movies that I love. Because I haven’t had that kind of contact in public spaces, and restaurants are so important to me. So there’s something about seeing people being together, and cooking, and eating in a film or in a TV show that’s just really doing it for me right now.

[music]

OK, so over the weekend, I watched “Big Night.”

archived recording (claudio villa) [SINGING IN ITALIAN]

So I intended to just watch the dinner scene, which is kind of an epic, Italian-style dinner, set in the 1950s. But when the movie opened, its Claudio Villa singing this very beautiful song with his operatic voice.

Waves are rolling on the Jersey shore, and I just ended up watching the whole movie. I feel like I just want to explain a tiny bit of the movie to you. So —

It’s about two brothers.

archived recording More salt.

Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub.

archived recording Not too fine. Sometimes you cut it too fine, then all you taste is the garlic.

tejal rao

Who are running a restaurant on the Jersey shore. And it’s a classic setup. The restaurant across the street from them is super successful. Meanwhile, their restaurant is really quiet, kind of failing. They owe the bank a lot of money. And part of it is that they just refuse to cook Italian-American food.

archived recording 1 But I get a side order of spaghetti with this, right? archived recording 2 Why? archived recording 3 Well, no. archived recording 4 I thought all main courses come with spaghetti. archived recording 5 Well some, yes.

archived recording [SINGING IN ITALIAN]

tejal rao

One of my favorite moments is just, like, Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub’s hairy forearms making the pasta. There’s something about seeing these bare, hairy forearms making a huge mess with egg yolks and flour, and kneading it directly on the table, where one of the cooks also sleeps. We’re all being so careful right now, as we should be, with gloves and masks. And the intimacy of the two of them cooking together and also cooking for other people, it’s a really, really beautiful scene. So, the rival restaurant across the street that’s doing really well, it’s run by this showboat restauranteur, who lights stuff on fire to create a scene in the dining room. And the brothers run this very quiet, simple restaurant. And the rival restauranteur says, you know what? I’m friends with Louis Prima, and he’s coming to town next week. And I’ll tell him to come to your restaurant. So why don’t you cook a special dinner for Louis Prima. And so they plan this big night to cook for a celebrity. And they’re waiting and waiting. And people start drinking and dancing and eating snacks. Wisps of hair coming undone, because people are starting to get a little wild. And they just sit down to eat dinner without Louis Prima.

archived recording No, no, no. We don’t have time for tour. Let’s go. Come on. Come on. [INAUDIBLE] open the door.

That’s where the magic of the movie happens. It’s all at the table.

archived recording 1 What is that? archived recording 2 It’s timpano. It’s a secret recipe that they brought from their hometown.

tejal rao

They’re in this very plain dining room. The music is blasting, and there’s always this moment at a dinner party when all of a sudden, people have had just enough to drink that they sort of start to loosen up. And you see it happen in real time in the movie.

And everyone’s making sure that everyone else’s glasses stay full all the time. It was like catnip for me. And it also emotionally kind of wrecked me to see people having so much fun. There’s something magical about seeing restaurants that are really, really alive and busy, and financially successful probably, too. It’s so fortifying to remember that we can gather like that again on the other side of this.

Hello?

michael barbaro

Hi.

jasmine lombrage

Hi, how are you?

michael barbaro

Oh, good. You sound great right now.

jasmine lombrage

Wonderful, wonderful. Hi. I’m Jasmine Lombrage.

michael barbaro

Hi, Jasmine. I’m Michael Barbaro.

jasmine lombrage

Hi, nice — nice to meet you this way.

michael barbaro

Very nice to meet you this way. Where exactly am I reaching you?

jasmine lombrage

I am at the Bullfish Bar Plus Kitchen here in Baton Rouge, La.

michael barbaro

That’s your restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

So how long have you lived in Baton Rouge?

jasmine lombrage

Me, personally, about 17 years. My husband has been here over 20 years. And we have two girls, two beautiful girls, Gaby — she’s turning 11 next month — and we have our gorgeous Angelle. She’s nine.

michael barbaro

How did you and your husband meet?

jasmine lombrage

[LAUGHS] It’s an old love story. We met at school. I was in dental hygiene school, and he was in culinary school. And he was working at that cafeteria. My friends said that they have good food over there, and they wanted to go. And so we went over there, and he was a quiet guy in the corner doing his own thing. I said, excuse me, what do you have here that is good and healthy that I can eat? And he looks up, and he said, Nothing is good enough for you.

michael barbaro

Oh, jeez.

jasmine lombrage

And then I turned to walk away, and he said, But if you come back tomorrow, I’ll make something for you.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

And I just kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. And I had a few friends who are like, Yes, we’re coming back tomorrow. So the next day, he made something for me. He made stir fry, and my friends — I had one of my crazy friends. She said — I said, I’m not going to eat. I don’t know if this guy is some kind of psycho or crazy and he’s going to put something in my food. She’s like, “Well, I’m going to eat. If nothing happens to me in a few minutes, then you — you can try it.” So that’s what happened. And he came back and asked, how was everything? I said, it was good. And then we started talking. Then — no then he said I’m going to be his wife, and I said, I’m sorry. That’s not going to happen. You know, and he said, well, he’s a praying man. He always gets his heart desire.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jasmine lombrage

Yes, 10 years later, we ended up married.

michael barbaro

So when you — when you two met, you were a dental hygienist student. He was training to be a chef.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And so how did you end up in the food industry?

jasmine lombrage

Well, growing up, my mom always cooked, you know, for many people. So it was always a passion. I grew up cooking also with mom and just family and aunts. We just — that was just something we did. And then Angel, my husband, Chef Angel, my husband, you know, we — he was the executive corporate chef that started Voodoo BBQ & Grill, which is a restaurant here in the South. And he was known as the Pitmaster. And so what we did, we started Jazz City then, Jazz City was a catering company. And we were — he was like, well, this is what I love to do. And we wanted to do something — we have two young kids. We know that, you know, you can work hard for anyone and everyone, but really, if you want to leave that — create something for your family, you need to create something so that it can stay down and passed down for generations and generations and possibly grow. And that is our goal is to have it grow and flourish. And we ended up here at the Bullfish, and Bullfish was already — it was a restaurant previously owned by someone else. And when we came here, we made it our own by bringing new menu items. And this is the only place you can come in Louisiana and find an authentic Caribbean and Southern fusion cuisine. What he’s done, what Chef has mastered, he’s taken the fresh herbs that we have in the Caribbean, and then he’s merged it with the wonderful spices that we have here in Louisiana. And he — there’s a fusion of jerk, fish, and Southern barbecue shrimp.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. And the paella — you know, Chef makes a paella with — you know, he uses scallops. And the crawfish, which is from Louisiana, he infuses that with the andouille sausage, and then he puts the shrimp in there and the crab meat. And so it’s just the different twist that he puts on all of the dishes. It’s just magic in your mouth.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

And I don’t know if you heard the music in the background a little. We kind of use a lot of Caribbean kind of music from different parts of the Caribbean, and we play different music from here. The vibe is just so, I don’t need a passport, but I can get away here. Does that makes sense?

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. It’s funny you keep calling your husband “chef.” Is that how you refer to him?

jasmine lombrage

At work, we keep it professional. At home, well, when we get in a car, it’s “honey.” But when we’re at work, we refer to each other — I refer to him as Chef, and he would just say whatever he had to say to me or, OK, yes, ma’am, and that would be it.

michael barbaro

Got it.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And when did you take over the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

That was last year, 2019, May 22, 2019.

michael barbaro

OK. So just about — just about a year ago.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. And this restaurant, the Bullfish, it is personal for us, because our home is connected to the Bullfish.

michael barbaro

Huh.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. So that’s why this pandemic — I personally have spent many nights not sleeping, because I know our home is connected to it. It’s not like we have 5, 6, 7, 20 locations. This is all we have. In our home, we have two kids. My daughter, my oldest, Gaby, she’s autistic. I don’t know — I mean, I don’t know what’s going to happen, but for now, she’s depending on us to care for her. So as she grows, the home is — before we committed our home to the Bullfish — was part of the security blanket that we had. In the event something happened, she would have that.

michael barbaro

Tell me what you mean when you say that your home is connected to Bullfish. You mean physically or emotionally or what?

jasmine lombrage

Well, whenever you get a loan, you have to give some kind of guarantee, like a personal guarantee. And that’s what we did, you know. We took that leap of faith and decided that we were going to put 100 percent in here to make it work. So we have to make the Bullfish work.

michael barbaro

So if something were to happen to the restaurant, it would mean potentially losing your home?

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And it sounds like that house is something you plan on passing on to your daughter, who’s autistic.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, well, both of our girls, but we know her, at least, we can have somewhere for her in case she needed somewhere to be, and then we can have that there for her. That is something that always gets me emotional talking about, because —

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

[CRYING] I’m sorry.

michael barbaro

I understand.

jasmine lombrage

It’s — you know, and she’s standing in front of me looking at me now. And we want to do whatever it takes to make it work. You know, we just have to make it work. So when this pandemic started, it really gave us a scare, because if we’re not able to pay for everything, and we default on our loan, well, we understood the consequences, you know.

michael barbaro

Was there a moment when you felt that you had really kind of made it with this place, having bought it and started to make it your own?

jasmine lombrage

Yes. About a month before the pandemic, we were like, yeah, this was a good choice. My husband and I, we usually go to early morning service for church, and afterwards, we came here for brunch. And then before we were open, we had people waiting outside for us.

michael barbaro

Wow.

jasmine lombrage

It was wonderful. And we were like, OK, wow, this is really going to work. This is really working. And wow, honey, this is our baby, and we’re going to grow it, and we’re going to be able to pay up the loan, and we’re going to be able to just blow this thing out of the park. And then the pandemic started. And yes.

michael barbaro

When did you first start to notice that the pandemic was impacting the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

OK, early March — early March, because it was February was good with Valentine’s Day. Early March is when everything started changing, and as March went on, the governor shut down the state. This is when, you know, you started losing staff members saying they’re not coming out. I mean, you cannot blame them. We also started doing curbside delivery, and we were doing social media posts and putting up signs, handwritten signs offering discounts, letting people know that curbside pickup is available, just getting different yard signs made.

michael barbaro

So you have to put up signs in the windows or outside telling people, we’re still around, you just need to call in.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, yes, yes. And then about maybe the second week after the state was closed, we would be lucky if we got two people that would call for curbside pickup. And we would just be sitting here the entire day, 11 to 8, and there’s no one that would come by or no one that would call. So then I started calling the restaurant phone a couple of times to make sure the phone was working, because it never rang. We were there for hours.

michael barbaro

So you called the restaurant’s main number with your cell phone just to see if it was working.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. [LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Wow

jasmine lombrage

And, you know, I started reaching out to third party — third party delivery providers to see if I can sign up with them, like Uber Eats and Waitr and DoorDash and ChowNow. And they’re charging — some of them are charging from 25 percent to 35 percent.

michael barbaro

Per order?

jasmine lombrage

Yeah, that’s your food costs. Yes. You know, in addition to that, we’re not able to buy in bulk anymore, because we’ve wasted so much food. We’ve thrown away so much stuff, so now we’re having to go ourselves, Chef and I, to different mom and pop stores that are open, and we’re having to purchase items. Of course, now you’re paying more money for them, because you’re not buying the same quantity anymore, and you’re buying from a local retailer. So, you know, and then we have a bar here, and we weren’t — no one was coming out to drink anymore, so that went away. So yeah, the pandemic, you know, it’s been hard on us.

michael barbaro

Mm-hm. I’m so sorry.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

So with these delivery apps, these new sources of orders, how much money do you make off of any individual customer percentage-wise?

jasmine lombrage

Right now, you don’t, because the fact that we’re buying things from not just local distributors but smaller volume — we’re buying things in smaller volume, so our profit margin is smaller. So we’re basically not making anything. You’re keeping the doors open, but you’re not making anything from it.

michael barbaro

Can you give us a sense of where your daughters have been throughout this period? At what point was their schooling interrupted?

jasmine lombrage

Maybe March. Angelle, when did school close? March or April?

angelle lombrage

[FAINT] It closed in March.

jasmine lombrage

OK, school closed in March.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

I used to bring my — I still do bring my two girls, so I can homeschool them, because school — they are out of school. So I use a corner of the restaurant, and I do schooling there for my girls. But it was a challenge. The change was not welcomed and open for the girls, especially my oldest, Gaby.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

jasmine lombrage

You know, with autism, everything has to be — you need to have something — everything scheduled and everything has a plan you need to follow through. And this whole pandemic kind of just went haywire for her in the beginning. She was not sleeping. She was more agitated. And my youngest, Angelle, she kept saying she wanted to go back to school, so I had to find other ways to help them. So —

michael barbaro

And Jasmine, I think I hear your daughters in the background. Is that right?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, you do.

michael barbaro

Do you think there was a point where your daughters picked up on what has been happening for you and your husband, but beyond the stresses that they’re experiencing, you know, from not being at school and social distancing, that they understood that you and your husband are struggling with this business and struggling financially?

jasmine lombrage

I think so. There is one incident. My daughter, my youngest, she — you know, she gets allowance, and someone gives her money or whatever. And she saved the money, and one day, she wrote a note. And then she left a note on the bed, on my bed. I was taking a bath, and I came out, and she had a note saying that, Mom, I know you and Dad are working really hard, and things are really tough. I have some money saved. I hope this helps for you to pay for stuff.

michael barbaro

Oh, wow.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. That was hard. That was hard.

michael barbaro

How old is this daughter who left you —

jasmine lombrage

Angelle was 8 when she did that. She just turned 9 in April. So she had a pandemic birthday.

michael barbaro

Can I ask how much she gave you?

jasmine lombrage

I think it was like $57 she had.

michael barbaro

Wow. And what did you do with it?

jasmine lombrage

I still have it saved. I still have it there. I try not to use it. It was just such a touching moment, and just to see, you know, that they realize, kids realize more than you let them know. And knowing that they’re here like almost every single day with me, and —

michael barbaro

They see everything.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

How bad are things, financially speaking, right now?

jasmine lombrage

Not close at all to where we want to be. Not good at all. Not good at all. We have applied for a lot of, you know, small business loans, and we’re just waiting to hear back.

michael barbaro

Have you been able to cover all the payments that you owe to the bank?

jasmine lombrage

I haven’t. I think finance is one of the things people don’t like to talk about, but I haven’t been able to meet a lot of — I had to ask for abatements. So we’ll see what happens.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. I mean, do you think there is a situation that you could imagine using that money from your youngest daughter, that $57?

jasmine lombrage

I don’t want to — I don’t want to, because it’s hers. Even though she gave it to me, it’s hers. I do not want — I don’t want to.

michael barbaro

Right.

jasmine lombrage

I — I’m just afraid to — I’m just afraid to even think about a situation like that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Jasmine, for listeners who don’t know what the rules are in Louisiana, what was announced earlier this week?

jasmine lombrage

Well, restaurants — commencing Friday, you can, restaurants can be open for 25 percent of the capacity.

michael barbaro

So you can seat up to 25 percent of what would normally fit inside the restaurant. So how many people do you think that is?

jasmine lombrage

Well, we can seat about 90 people comfortably in here. And so about 25 percent of that now is what we’re allowed to do.

michael barbaro

So if you can only put, you know, 20 or so people inside, can you make money?

jasmine lombrage

I don’t see how that’s going to happen, to be honest with you, because 20 percent — having 20 percent of people inside the business is not enough to sustain, and I don’t know how long that’s going to go on for.

michael barbaro

Right.

jasmine lombrage

So [SIGHS] it’s hard. It’s a hard thing to digest right now.

michael barbaro

But you have decided that you’re going to let people back inside?

jasmine lombrage

Honestly, me, personally, no. So it is still an open debate. We — actually, after I’m done with this interview, we’re going to sit down and weigh our options, the pros and the cons, and see if it’s something that we want to do.

michael barbaro

Can I ask you what you see as the cons and the pros?

jasmine lombrage

Yeah, the pros — that, you know, we’ll have 25 percent more revenue than what we’re seeing now. And then the cons is knowing that someone will — I’m afraid that, oh, my god, somebody’s going to come out, and they’re a carrier of Covid-19, and they infect somebody else. So I have no way of controlling that.

michael barbaro

Have you heard from customers about their opinions on whether it’s time to go back inside the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, I have. I’ve had mixed reviews. We tend to ask customers, whenever they’re picking up or, are they ready for everything to open back up. That’s normally the question we would ask. And I feel that I’m getting more nos than yes, though, in my opinion.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

Those who have told you, Jasmine, that they do want to come out, what did they say is their reason for wanting to come out, to come back and eat in a restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

They want to get out of the house. You know, sometimes it’s just the fact that you cannot do something makes you want to do it.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes. Yes, the forbidden fruit. Yes.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. My point, that’s exactly. Like, oh, you tell me I cannot eat this? OK, I’m going to. So yes, that’s what I feel I’m getting.

michael barbaro

I wonder, for you, if you didn’t run a restaurant, would you go out and eat right now? Would you walk into a restaurant, sit down, order food?

jasmine lombrage

I would probably go out on a weekday, because weekdays are usually less busy, because I have a child that has a compromised immune system. So I’m usually very careful to go out. I don’t want to take something home to her, so that would be another reason that I personally will not go out. And if I did go out, minus my daughter’s situation, I would have definitely found the seat — ask to be seated in the area that is far away from everybody else.

michael barbaro

I mean it’s interesting to hear you say that, that you wouldn’t want to go to a restaurant unless it was specifically at a slow time because of the health of your daughter, because you’re talking about yourself reopening a restaurant. So it’s quite a weird conundrum.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, but it’s honest.

michael barbaro

I just want to make sure I understand which of your daughters is immunocompromised.

jasmine lombrage

Gaby is.

michael barbaro

Is that the daughter who is autistic?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, because she was a former premature baby. I ruptured at 14 weeks when I was pregnant with her, and she had a lot of health challenges. They said, you know, that Gaby would never walk, talk, see, or hear. She was not via — she does not have any viability of life, and that she would never make it out of the hospital alive, you know. We were told that we were making a mistake for her. She coded, and it was even pronounced, and she came back. And she had a trach before, and she was on a ventilator before. She was on oxygen for the first — almost the first four years of her life. You know, she started talking late, walking late, and she had to do therapy, and, you know, she had a walker. So she had a lot of challenges to see where she is now and where she came from. So I’m always careful, you know. A typical cold for you and I is just a cold, but for her, it can lead to pneumonia, or we’ve lost her. We’ve had her stop breathing a couple times, and nothing — I don’t even know how to explain that.

michael barbaro

Mm. Given your daughter’s health, are you worried that you’re going to basically be in the kind of situation it sounds like you’re afraid of kind of all the time, because people are going to be coming into your restaurant, and they could potentially get you sick, and you could potentially get your daughter sick?

jasmine lombrage

Yes. You know, I don’t know what I would do if I find myself bringing something to my child. So I find myself in a very difficult position as a business owner.

michael barbaro

That would be very hard to live with. I understand.

jasmine lombrage

That would — yes. You know —

michael barbaro

I mean, it sounds — it sounds like that —

jasmine lombrage

[SIGHS]

michael barbaro

— that has to — that has to be weighing on you as you’re making this decision.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, it is. It is. It is. This is personal. This is not like, oh, OK, well, I’m just going to open and make the money. It’s not that situation for me. I have to be careful for it. I am responsible for her, and I’m also responsible for my customers, making sure they have the best experience. And I’m also responsible for my team that are coming to work. So —

michael barbaro

And you’re also responsible for that house —

jasmine lombrage

Yes!

michael barbaro

— that is connected to this —

jasmine lombrage

Right!

michael barbaro

— restaurant.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

jasmine lombrage

So my hands are tied. Like, yes. It — yes, I’m just — I’m just in a bind. Yeah, I’m just in a bind right now. And say hi, Gaby.

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Hi, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Say hi. It’s OK.

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Oh, I want to see you on the video. Nice to meet you, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Can you see her? I don’t know how this works.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. I can see her. Yeah, she’s got a great — she’s got a leopard patterned sweater on.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. Are you going to talk?

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Hi. Gaby is waving.

gaby lombrage

How are you doing?

michael barbaro

I’m doing well. Your mom was just telling us about you. She — she loves you.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. [LAUGHS] Yes.

michael barbaro

She loves you — she loves you very much.

jasmine lombrage

I do. I love you, Gab.

gaby lombrage

I love you, too.

jasmine lombrage

OK.

michael barbaro

Well, that was — that was a nice gift.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, she walked up, so. [SIGH] I’m sorry.

michael barbaro

Yeah, just give me a sec. Oof.

jasmine lombrage

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that —

michael barbaro

No, I —

jasmine lombrage

Hence the reason why I’m torn up. For someone that was 1 pound, 3 ounces when she was born, she is like — she’s like — I mean she’s beautiful. She’s doing so well. And then this is so scary.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

jasmine lombrage

This is so scary, you know. And then it’s a hard decision. I — we don’t open up, then to get customers to come in, we’re putting our house more at risk. We open up, and then something happens, then I’m putting my child’s life at risk. I don’t want — I don’t even want to be me right now.

michael barbaro

Yep. I’m going to be really eager — we’re all going to be very eager to understand what decision you make. And I want you to know that we really enjoyed getting to know you and talking to you, and we’re rooting for you and for your family.

jasmine lombrage

Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you.

michael barbaro

Thank you, and please give our best to your husband and to the rest of your family.

jasmine lombrage

Thank you.

gaby lombrage

Bye.

jasmine lombrage

Gaby says bye.

michael barbaro

Bye, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Say bye.

gaby lombrage

Bye.

jasmine lombrage

OK, thank you, guys.

michael barbaro

Bye.

[music]

michael barbaro

On Thursday night, after we spoke, Jasmine, her husband, and their staff decided that they would reopen their restaurant for indoor dining, starting on Tuesday. We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (rick bright) Good morning, Chairwoman Eshoo and Ranking Member Burgess and distinguished members of the subcommittee. I am Dr. Rick Bright, a career public servant, and a scientist who has spent 25 years of my career focused on addressing pandemic outbreaks.

michael barbaro

In testimony, before the House on Thursday, a whistleblower, who was fired as head of a federal research agency, said that the Trump administration failed to heed his warnings about the shortage of medical supplies in the national stockpile and that Americans died as a result.

archived recording (rick bright) Congresswoman, we’ve known for quite some time that our stockpile is insufficient in having those critical personal protective equipment. So once this virus began spreading, it became known to be a threat, I began pushing urgently in January, along with some industry colleagues as well, and those urges, those alarms were not responded to with action.

michael barbaro

His testimony marked the first time that a federal scientist has gone before Congress and openly accused the Trump administration of endangering American lives by bungling its response to the coronavirus.

trusted	The Saga of Michael Flynn	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/podcasts/the-daily/michael-flynn.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	"michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: Federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mark Mazzetti on what led to that decision. It’s Thursday, May 14. Mark, remind us where the Michael Flynn story starts.

mark mazzetti

Well, Michael Flynn was a three-star Army general who had a quite distinguished career, became the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under the Obama administration. And then he gradually sort of moves into the Trump orbit in 2016 when Trump was running for president. During the Republican convention —

archived recording (michael flynn) We do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law.

mark mazzetti

— he famously leads a chant —

archived recording (crowd) Lock her up! archived recording (michael flynn) Yes, that’s right, lock her up!

mark mazzetti

Of “lock her up,” meaning to Hillary Clinton.

michael barbaro

Right.

archived recording (michael flynn) If I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.

mark mazzetti

And after Trump is elected, he announces that he’s going to make Flynn his national security adviser. So it’s during this time when there’s a series of events that get Michael Flynn into trouble.

[music]

It’s shortly after Christmas in 2016 when the Obama administration announces a number of sanctions against Russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign. It was soon after that —

archived recording The Washington Post reports that Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, repeatedly called the Russian ambassador to the U.S. —

mark mazzetti

— that The Washington Post reported that Flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the Russian ambassador —

archived recording — on the exact same day —

mark mazzetti

— on the same day the Obama sanctions were announced, which raised questions about whether the incoming Trump administration was trying to meddle with the Obama administration’s foreign policy.

archived recording (mike pence) I talked to General Flynn about that conversation. Actually, it was —

mark mazzetti

Vice President-elect Mike Pence goes on “Face the Nation.”

archived recording (mike pence) They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to impose a censure against Russia.

mark mazzetti

Pence says that Flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call. But the Justice Department had transcripts of the calls in which Flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the Obama administration’s sanctions.

archived recording F.B.I. agents interviewed Michael Flynn about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian —

mark mazzetti

So F.B.I. agents are sent to the White House to interview Flynn.

archived recording What has he told investigators?

mark mazzetti

He tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s lying to the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

Right. This all becomes public, and in February 2017 —

archived recording General Michael Flynn suddenly resigned late last night.

mark mazzetti

— Flynn is forced to resign.

archived recording He is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what happens to Flynn once he’s pushed out of the White House?

mark mazzetti

The F.B.I. continues to investigate Flynn, but very little is heard from him for a number of months. And during this time, President Trump starts leaning on James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in essence, to drop the Flynn investigation.

michael barbaro

Right.

mark mazzetti

And that raised this idea that the President of the United States was trying to obstruct justice. And that’s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only Comey being fired, but also the appointment of Mueller as the special counsel.

michael barbaro

Right. In many ways, the Flynn saga is the beginning of the Mueller saga, and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the Trump administration.

mark mazzetti

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

What ends up happening to Michael Flynn?

mark mazzetti

Well —

archived recording Flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

Flynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

Becomes a cooperating witness in the Mueller investigation. He’s awaiting sentence.

archived recording Court documents make clear that Flynn was not acting alone.

mark mazzetti

And the significance was that he was the first top White House official to plead guilty as part of the Mueller investigation.

archived recording Court papers say Flynn could get up to six months behind bars, but he was under —

michael barbaro

Mark, I feel like, for many people, that is where the Michael Flynn story pretty much ends, right? I mean, you have this three-star general, national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the F.B.I., and now he’s headed to prison.

mark mazzetti

That’s right. And the Mueller investigation marches on, and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when Flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge. And the Mueller team weighs in —

archived recording Breaking news right now. Bob Mueller’s office is recommending to the judge that Michael Flynn actually not receive any prison time.

mark mazzetti

— and says Flynn’s been a good witness.

archived recording Michael Flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel.

mark mazzetti

They recommend very little, if any, jail time.

archived recording The defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials.

mark mazzetti

And something curious happens then, where Flynn’s legal team, which had been very cooperative towards the Mueller investigation, clearly — they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the Mueller team — decide to take a more combative stance. They enter into the public record this idea that maybe Flynn had been railroaded, that the F.B.I. may have set him up. So this angers the judge. He really reads Flynn and his team the riot act, saying, are you now saying you’re not remorseful? And why are you now accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct? And basically says, let’s take a pause. We’re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you’ve found some remorse. In the intervening time, the ground starts to shift.

[music]

archived recording William Barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general, gaining broad control of the special counsel, Robert Mueller’s, Russia investigation.

mark mazzetti

William Barr takes over as attorney general.

archived recording (william barr) I believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation.

mark mazzetti

He, during his confirmation hearing, pledges that he’s not going to interfere with the Mueller investigation. So Mueller famously then delivers his report to Barr in March of 2019.

archived recording (william barr) The deputy attorney general and I concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.

mark mazzetti

And Barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes Mueller’s findings, which we now know misinterprets the Mueller report. It’s quite clear starting at that point that Barr has great issues with not only the Mueller investigation, but how this all began — how the Russia investigation began at the F.B.I. and whether there was real misconduct.

archived recording (william barr) I’ve been trying to get answers to questions, and I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate, and I also —

mark mazzetti

So he makes no secret of the fact that he’s going to start investigating the investigation. He is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after Donald J. Trump and his advisers.

michael barbaro

And what does that mean for Michael Flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the F.B.I.?

mark mazzetti

As the ground shifts, and as it’s clear that Barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation, Flynn decides to get a new lawyer.

archived recording (sidney powell) Nothing about this case was done right. They violated every rule, every protocol.

mark mazzetti

Who is not only a lawyer, but also a pundit of sorts.

archived recording (sidney powell) The entire prosecution was false. It must be dismissed.

mark mazzetti

This is a Texas lawyer named Sidney Powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt.

archived recording (sidney powell) Their prosecution of General Flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president, because they already knew the Russia hoax had fallen apart.

mark mazzetti

Very much in line with what the President of the United States has said.

archived recording (sidney powell) So the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

And days before she takes over as Flynn’s lawyer, she writes a secret letter to Attorney General Barr where she writes, quote, “It is increasingly apparent that General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes.”

michael barbaro

Wow. So you’re saying Flynn recognizes the winds are changing, recognizing that there’s literally a new sheriff, attorney general in town, who’s skeptical of the entire Russia investigation, and so Flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic.

mark mazzetti

Yes. And during that period of time, Attorney General Barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who’s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place.

michael barbaro

So just to be clear, in addition to examining the roots of the Russia investigation broadly, Barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the Department of Justice just to examine the Flynn case?

mark mazzetti

That’s right.

[music]

And that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both Flynn’s lawyers and the president to make the case that Michael Flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the F.B.I.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Mark, tell us what’s inside these documents.

mark mazzetti

In essence, the documents are internal F.B.I. and Justice Department communications around the time that Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. And what they show, kind of broadly, are that there was concern about the decision to interview Flynn. One of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by Bill Priestap, who at the time was the head of the F.B.I.‘s Counterintelligence Division, which was running the whole Russia investigation. And this is January 24, four days after the Trump administration takes over, and right before there is this decision to go send F.B.I. agents to interview the national security adviser. And Priestap writes, quote, “What’s our goal, truth/admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”

michael barbaro

Wow.

mark mazzetti

In another document, he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview, and he says, “Protect our institution by not playing games. And if we are seen playing games, the White House will be furious.”

michael barbaro

Some of that language is quite potentially inflammatory, the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired — essentially, to get him in trouble.

mark mazzetti

It raises this question of whether Sidney Powell, Flynn’s lawyers, had a point, that they were trying to set him up, right? And finally, there’s also interesting divide that is revealed between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of Justice Department about what the F.B.I. was up to.

michael barbaro

So there’s some concern about whether or not interviewing Flynn is at all a good idea.

mark mazzetti

Right. And we find out that the F.B.I. only tells the Justice Department they’re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the White House.

michael barbaro

Huh. Mark, what happens once these internal F.B.I. documents are released? What’s the reaction?

mark mazzetti

This unleashes a torrent of criticism.

archived recording (sidney powell) He should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt.

mark mazzetti

By Flynn’s lawyer, Sidney Powell —

archived recording (sidney powell) — that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing Mr. Flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up.

mark mazzetti

— by other commentators on the right —

archived recording 1 A lot of people close to this feel like Michael Flynn was setup, never lied. archived recording 2 Admitting that they got things completely wrong, and actively worked to defame — archived recording 3 Instead, it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the F.B.I. handled Hillary Clinton and how they handled Donald Trump.

mark mazzetti

— by President Trump —

archived recording (donald trump) When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn.

mark mazzetti

— making the case that Flynn should never have been interviewed, and the case should now be dropped.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what would be the legal basis for that argument? What in the documents do Flynn’s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate?

mark mazzetti

Well, they’re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the F.B.I. about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

mark mazzetti

And if the interview doesn’t take place, then there’s no lies to worry about. And if there’s no lies, then there’s nothing to prosecute Flynn on. And therefore, there is no case period, and Michael Flynn should walk free. You have no predicate to be there in the beginning, then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation. And this is what Barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week.

archived recording Just in this afternoon, the Justice Department is dropping its criminal case against President Trump’s former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn.

mark mazzetti

To drop the charges against Michael Flynn.

archived recording The Justice Department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of Flynn.

mark mazzetti

Barr said there was never any good reason to interview Michael Flynn in the first place, and so whatever Flynn said during the interview was irrelevant. And Barr even goes further than that.

archived recording (catherine herridge) Attorney General Barr, thank you for speaking first to CBS news. archived recording (william barr) Hi, Catherine.

mark mazzetti

In an interview last week, he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview Flynn —

archived recording (william barr) There was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation —

mark mazzetti

— but he also goes to bat for Flynn going all the way back to Flynn’s phone calls with the Russian ambassador.

archived recording (william barr) And it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders. And that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. In fact, it was laudable. And it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administration’s policies, and it was in U.S. interest. He was saying to the Russians, don’t escalate.

mark mazzetti

He actually says that the phone calls were laudable, and that it was perfectly understandable that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment.

archived recording When history looks back on this decision, how do you think it will be written? archived recording (william barr) Well, history is written by the winners, so it largely depends on who’s writing the history.

michael barbaro

I mean, what’s fascinating about what Barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the Department of Justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant.

mark mazzetti

And it’s in keeping with what William Barr has done for a year. From the time that Robert Mueller presented his report to barr, Barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation. He has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly, or whether the F.B.I. overreached. He has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others.

michael barbaro

Mark, is Barr’s legal analysis in the Flynn case sound? Is it in dispute?

mark mazzetti

Barr’s decision has been widely criticized. Plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue, what is germane to the case, and in this specific instance, the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between Trump aides and the Russians would make Flynn’s calls germane to this particular investigation. That is not to say that now looking back, there haven’t been instances of F.B.I. abuse over the course of the Russia investigation.

michael barbaro

Mark, given everything you’ve just said, and reading these documents that have been released from the Department of Justice about the debate that went on inside the F.B.I. — these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview, whether they might, basically, trap Flynn in a lie and get him fired — I mean, is there a version of this where what Bill Barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution, which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant?

mark mazzetti

You always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted. That’s true if the target is Michael Flynn, or if the target is someone far less famous. The concern, of course, is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

mark mazzetti

That what the attorney general is doing is, in effect, launching a campaign to discredit the investigation, to discredit the Mueller probe, to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss, President Trump. Remember, President Trump, who’s been railing against the quote unquote “witch hunt” for years, will be using this for his re-election campaign. So the concern, of course, is that Bill Barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president.

michael barbaro

But Mark, is it possible that both things can be true — that the Attorney General Bill Barr may be trying to discredit the entire Russia investigation, and in the process, very much oversimplify things, and that the prosecution of Michael Flynn might be flawed?

mark mazzetti

Yes, both of those things can be true.

[music]

And this is why the passions are so intense on this issue, because both sides want to control the narrative, and because of that, can’t allow, necessarily, any gray area in this argument. Either Michael Flynn is a hero or he’s a traitor. Either the Mueller investigation was a just pursuit, or it was a witch hunt. And of course, there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white.

michael barbaro

So Mark, what’s going to happen to Michael Flynn now?

mark mazzetti

Well, of course, given what William Barr decided, there is a very likely scenario that Michael Flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold, and in the coming months, we see him once again campaigning for Donald Trump.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Mark.

mark mazzetti

Thanks, Michael.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday night, The Times reported that before the Department of Justice sought to throw out the case against Michael Flynn, it had interviewed the F.B.I. official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap Flynn. In that interview, the official, Bill Priestap, said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set Flynn up.

[music]

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity —

michael barbaro

In a speech on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the American economy if Congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment.

archived recording (jerome powell) Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt.

michael barbaro

The message from Jerome Powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that Congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough.

archived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.

michael barbaro

And the House of Representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely, so that they can avoid traveling to Washington during the pandemic. The rules, expected to pass tomorrow, would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person.

Though the number of new deaths has been curving downward, the virus continues to circulate widely within the United States.

Businesses are reopening

All 50 states have started to reopen their economies in some capacity. But the number of businesses that are back open varies widely from state to state and even county to county.

“You have 50 different governors doing 50 different things,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “There will be states that open too soon or states that are too conservative. It is hard to thread the needle.”

In New Jersey, which has the second-most cases per capita, residents remained largely on lockdown, with only certain industries allowed to resume operations. In Connecticut, offices were allowed to open, with masks required and layouts adjusted to ensure social distancing. And in Alaska, where relatively few cases have been identified, but where several visiting workers have tested positive in recent days, restaurants, gyms and other businesses were preparing to return to full capacity.

“It will all be open,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy of Alaska said, “just like it was prior to the virus.”

Many states began to reopen despite not meeting White House guidelines for progress against the virus. And some, like Texas and Minnesota, relaxed restrictions even as case numbers rose.

But governors in more restrictive states have faced increasing pressure, including in Illinois, where some Republican legislators sued the Democratic governor, in Michigan, where a man in Detroit was accused of threatening to kill the Democratic governor and attorney general, and in North Carolina, where President Trump pressed the Democratic governor for assurances that the Republican National Convention in Charlotte could proceed as planned.

Case numbers in North Carolina have risen rapidly in recent days, with many of the new cases concentrated in rural counties.

“Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August,” Mr. Trump said Monday in a series of Twitter posts. “They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site.”

Despite troubling trend lines in places like Arizona and Arkansas, and persistently high case numbers in Chicago and Los Angeles, the news in much of the country is encouraging. Reports of new cases have been steady or declining in most states, even as testing becomes more widely available. Around Detroit and New Orleans, where explosive growth stretched hospitals early in the pandemic, the situation has improved dramatically in recent weeks. In Hawaii and Vermont, few new cases are being spotted. And in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which have some of the highest per-capita infection rates, cases have been trending downward.

Case numbers spike in meatpacking cities

Across the country, production at meatpacking plants and other food processing centers has slowed or stopped because of large outbreaks, including one at a Smithfield facility in South Dakota that sickened more than 1,000 people and three at Tyson facilities in Iowa that sickened hundreds of people.

The Times has identified more than 100 food processing facilities across the country with coronavirus outbreaks. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at least 4,900 meat and poultry processing workers had been infected across 19 states, and at least 20 had died. Though outbreaks have been reported in every region of the country, the rural Midwest and South have been especially hard hit.

Some companies, including Smithfield, have refused to answer even basic questions about the size of their outbreaks. And in some places, state and local health officials have also been silent. In Kansas, state officials said there were more than 2,300 meatpacking-related cases and seven deaths spread across 10 clusters, but they refused to name those facilities. In Nebraska, where the National Guard has helped with the mass-testing of meatpacking workers, state and local officials have often refused to provide details. Officials in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, among other places, have also not provided that information.

Small counties with large meatpacking industries have reported some of the country’s highest numbers of cases per capita. In Nobles County, Minn., 631 workers at a pork processing plant have tested positive. In Cass County, Ind., where at least 900 Tyson workers tested positive, the number of known cases surged from roughly 50 to more than 1,400 over three weeks. And in Dakota County, Neb., which has the second-highest per capita infection rate of any American county, roughly one of every 13 residents has tested positive.

The outbreaks have proved devastating to the immigrant communities that often supply much of the labor at those plants, as well as to the farmers who depend on the facilities for their livelihoods.

Mr. Trump recently declared the meatpacking plants to be critical infrastructure, part of an effort to keep the facilities open. But restaurants have already reported meat shortages, many grocery stores have imposed quotas on meat purchases and some farmers have euthanized animals they could not take to market. In central Nebraska, the mayor of Grand Island called for federal help testing employees of his city’s hard-hit JBS USA beef processing plant. And in Illinois, where there have been multiple meatpacking outbreaks, Attorney General Kwame Raoul called for federal action to keep workers safe.

“This executive order lacks meaningful safety measures and puts workers at processing plants at risk,” said Mr. Raoul, a Democrat.

New York: 369,800 cases have been identified

Case numbers in New York and New Jersey, by far the country’s hardest-hit states, have trended steeply downward in recent days. Officials have started implementing plans for a slow, cautious reopening of the economy.

“Anyone who tells you they know the script doesn’t know what they’re talking about,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said recently. “We all wish we did but we don’t.”

The continuing toll of this spring has been immense. People with the virus have died in more than 40 New York counties, including more than 1,400 victims each in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties. New York City has fared the worst, with thousands of known cases and hundreds of deaths in each borough. Mayor Bill de Blasio compared the pandemic to “many Katrinas.”

Even as the number of new cases has dropped, the city continues to report more than almost anyplace else in the United States. And about 100 children in the state have been treated for a mysterious illness that causes life-threatening inflammation in critical organs and which appears to be connected to the coronavirus.

“This is a truly disturbing situation,” Mr. Cuomo said. “And I know parents around the state and around the country are very concerned about this, and they should be.”

Nearby, New Jersey has also suffered. More than 154,000 people in the state have tested positive for the virus, and more than 11,000 have died. But that state was also seeing signs of progress and beginning to slowly ease restrictions.

“We want to make sure we do it right, responsibly, and that we don’t kill anybody by doing it too fast,” Gov. Philip D. Murphy said Sunday during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Though New York and New Jersey have by far had the most cases, other Northeastern states have also seen severe outbreaks. Despite recent improvement, Massachusetts continues to report more than 800 new cases most days. Rhode Island has one of the country’s highest per capita infection rates. And in Connecticut, where 85 deaths had been linked to the virus at the start of April, the death total has now passed 3,600.

See how the rate of deaths has changed over time in different states and countries.

In America’s nursing homes, outbreaks surge

Across the country, a pattern has played out with tragic consistency: Someone gets sick in a nursing home. Soon, several residents and employees have the coronavirus. The New York Times has identified more than 9,000 nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases. More than 197,000 residents and staff members at those facilities have contracted the virus, and more than 37,000 have died. That means one third of the deaths in the pandemic have been linked to long-term care facilities.

Older people and those with underlying health problems are most vulnerable to Covid-19, making the consequences of a nursing home outbreak especially devastating. More than 50 deaths have been linked to the virus at a dozen facilities. In California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, the virus has been identified in more than 400 long-term care facilities.

The New York Times is tracking the coronavirus at nursing homes and long-term care centers. Do you or a family member live or work in one of these facilities? If so, we’d like to hear from you.

“This disease creates the potential for a perfect storm in a long-term care facility — large groups of vulnerable people living together and a highly transmissible virus that may not cause symptoms in those who care for them,” said Dr. Daniel Rusyniak, the chief medical officer for Indiana’s state social services agency.

Though all sorts of nursing homes have suffered, those with a higher percentage of black and Latino residents have been likelier to be hit with the virus.

Following critical media reports and public pressure, the Trump administration told the operators of the nation’s nursing homes to let patients and their families know if there are cases of the coronavirus within their facilities. The order will require the facilities to report such cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within about 12 hours or face fines.

Though many of the first coronavirus cases in the United States were tied to overseas travel, localized outbreaks have become increasingly common. New clusters in nursing homes and other settings, including a psychiatric hospital in Nevada and a date-packing facility in California, are emerging each day.

Times journalists have for weeks tracked clusters of cases and deaths across the country. The largest such outbreaks include state prisons in Ohio and Tennessee, a federal prison complex in California, meatpacking plants in the Midwest and an aircraft carrier that was docked in Guam. The deadliest outbreaks have been in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.

Theodore Roosevelt — Guam 969 Harris County jail — Houston, Texas 947 Show all

Some agencies and facilities have refused to release the numbers of cases or deaths. More than 1,500 inmates and guards have tested positive across New York City’s 10 jails, and 13 deaths have been tied to those facilities, but officials have refused to provide a breakdown for each jail.

Prisons have been overwhelmed by the virus

The Times has counted more than 47,000 coronavirus infections and 485 deaths in inmates and staff at state prisons, federal prisons and local jails. The country’s three largest known coronavirus clusters are in prisons that have more than 1,300 cases each.

Nearly every state prison system has at least one infection among either inmates or staff. Many of the infections have been asymptomatic, suggesting that the problem is more common than is understood. Fear and pessimism has settled in among inmates. Riots in Kansas and Washington State were led by inmates worried about contracting the coronavirus, prison officials said.

Inmates say that they have not been kept informed by prison administrators about correctional officers who have tested positive. That has left prisoners saying they feel especially vulnerable and also concerned that they might be infected and unwittingly passing the virus on to other inmates.

“You can’t really track it and know who had contact with who,” said Dennis McKeithan, a prison inmate in Pennsylvania. “The secrecy is making things more unsafe because people won’t be able to realize, ‘Oh, I had contact with that guy myself,’ and then go ahead and get tested.”

During interviews with more than two dozen inmates across the nation, prisoners say that correctional facilities are responding to the crisis far too slowly. At Wyoming Correctional Facility in Attica, N.Y., Tracy White, 30, said that only workers on the serving line in the prison’s mess hall are required to wear masks covering their nose and mouth.

“A lot of people are nervous, tense, scared,” Mr. White said.

Social distancing, he said, is impossible. Beds are placed three feet apart. As Mr. White spoke over a prison telephone, he said another inmate was on another phone less than two feet away. He said he had cleaned the phone as best as he could, but that he was also wearing a sock on his hand to protect himself from germs.

Elijah McDowell, an inmate in Connecticut, said the sweep of coronavirus through his prison -- including the death of several inmates -- had made a bleak existence even more grim.

“Every day is nerve-racking,” he said. “I already have to fight things every day, but fighting the coronavirus, it’s not a fair fight because they keep us in the dark about a lot of things.”

At Cook County Jail in Chicago, where nearly 1,000 inmates and staff have been infected, Antonio House said he washed his hands regularly and tried to be as sanitary as possible in order to stay healthy. But he said the strain of being unable to maintain six feet of distance from guards and other inmates who do not always wear masks was at times overwhelming.

“Mentally, it’s rough,” said Mr. House, 45. “It’s scary. I’m fearful because I don’t know how my body will respond if I catch it.”

Several days after the interview, LaSheda Brooks -- who is Mr. House’s daughter -- said her father had contracted the coronavirus. He is currently recovering, she said.

Cases, deaths continue to mount around Chicago

As some major cities have seen their cases decline, new infections have remained stubbornly high around Chicago. More than 40,000 people in the city have been infected and more than 1,800 have died. Add in the suburbs, and those numbers more than double.

Chicago’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, said recently that many in her city had defied orders to stay home and hosted large house parties that the police have had to break up. After watching the plight of New York City, Ms. Lightfoot was taking a cautious approach to eventually reopening her city.

“I feel the burden of having to say to people, ‘Stay inside for your own safety,’” said Ms. Lightfoot, who said she hoped the city could start slowly reopening in early June. “But that is the right thing to do.”

As in much of the country, black and Hispanic people have suffered disproportionately in the Midwest. In Michigan, where less than 15 percent of residents are black, about 40 percent of those who died from the virus have been. In South Dakota, where about 7 percent of residents are black or Hispanic, 36 percent of coronavirus patients are members of those groups. And in Illinois, officials said recently that about 60 percent of Hispanic people who were tested for the virus were positive, three times the average for other Illinoisans.

“While we can’t fix generations of disparities in the span of a few months, we must advance equity in our public health response,” said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who said longstanding “obstacles for members of our Latino communities are now amplified in this pandemic.”"	Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count		['The New York Times']	['latest', 'deaths', 'virus', 'count', 'united', 'map', 'state', 'york', 'times', 'facilities', 'cases', 'case', 'coronavirus', 'states']	"Reported cases in the United States Total cases Deaths Per capita Share of population with a reported case No cases reported Double-click to zoom into the map.

The United States has crossed an uneasy threshold, with all 50 states beginning to reopen in some way after the coronavirus thrust the country into lockdown. But there are substantial variations in how states are deciding to open up, with some forging far ahead of others.

The changes reflect the immense pressures weighing on the nation’s governors to respond to a crippled economy and an anxious public, even as epidemiologists warn of the potential for a second wave of cases. Cases were rising in about a dozen states in recent days, including several states that allowed early reopenings.

How States Shut Down These maps show which states had statewide stay-at-home orders in place on a given date. March 23 March 30 April 7

The New York Times is tracking when orders to stay at home are lifted in each state, as well as when broad reopenings are allowed. A state is categorized as “reopening” once its stay-at-home order lifts, or once reopening is permitted in at least one major sector (restaurants, retail stores, personal care businesses), or once reopening is permitted in a combination of smaller sectors. A state is categorized as “regional reopening” if, by and large, the governor permits certain counties or regions to open while others remain closed. States may shift categories as conditions change, or to account for changes in the national landscape.

trusted	Coronavirus Tips, Advice and Answers to Your New Questions	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	"The coronavirus pandemic has reached nearly every continent and left hundreds of thousands of people dead and seriously ill.

Daily life for millions more has been upended in ways both big and small. Offices, factories and schools have shut down for extended periods of time. Hospitals have scrambled for equipment and beds. Millions have lost their jobs.

Governments around the world are reacting in varying ways to the crisis. In the United States, the federal government has enacted recovery plans, one of which is the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history. Countries and regions are beginning to reopen, but what is to come is very much unknown.

We know you have questions about staying healthy, preventing the spread of this disease, what to do if you’ve lost your job, and more about restarting this new normal.

Staying In

Mental Health

Travel

Can I travel? Is it safe? + Yes, depending on where you want to go, and not easily, as where it is possible to travel and whether it is wise to do so are increasingly complicated questions. In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they imposed travel restrictions and many closed their borders. Now some states and countries are opening up, but it's a complicated patchwork of what is open and whether self-isolation or quarantines are required for entry. And if you do have to travel, remember to practice social distancing: Stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people. Many destinations, from Spain to Massachusetts, continue to urge visitors to self-isolate for two weeks after entry. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. How can I protect myself while flying? + If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Read More How to Disinfect Your Space on an Airplane I don't mind being alone, but I'd like to do it somewhere else. Is it possible to road trip responsibly? + If you decide to travel, follow a general rule: “Don’t go far, stay in your car,” said Robert Sinclair Jr., a Northeast regional spokesman for AAA. Mr. Sinclair offered other advice. When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you. Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAA’s general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car. And remember: With guidelines on travel changing rapidly state by state, the rules at your starting point may be different than the rules at your destination. Read More Here’s what else to consider if you’re traveling by car. What about a national park? Can I go off into the wilderness and be alone? + It’s a tempting idea, isn’t it? To explore a national park and be away from other people. These parks are slowly reopening in limited, staggered fashion in the hopes that they can limit visitors and control the number of people coming in. Check their websites to see their hours and what part of each park is opened. My plans got derailed. Can I get a refund? + With airlines cutting trans-Atlantic flights and cruise lines canceling sailings, travel conditions and refund policies are changing daily. But it depends, some operators, facing dire straits themselves, are issuing credits for future travel instead of refunds. Keep an eye on social media and official communications from your airline, hotel, cruise or wherever you booked to stay up to date with any changes to refund policies. And expect long wait times if you do need to contact a company. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. If I cancel my flight, will I get my money back? + Airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel (or significantly delay) flights because of the coronavirus pandemic. That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for canceled flights to, within or from the United States. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel refunds. What about travel insurance? + Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips only under very specific circumstances. But if you purchased cancel-for-any-reason insurance for your trip, there’s a good chance you will get a good share of your money back. Be sure to read the fine print on your coverage before speaking with a representative. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. I can’t get my airline on the phone. What should I do? + “Obviously, the 800 numbers are overwhelmed,” said Michael Holtz, the founder and chief executive of SmartFlyer, a luxury travel agency. Many airlines in the United States have informed travelers that they could expect longer wait times to speak to a customer service agent. Some have redirected callers to their websites and their apps, or asked travelers to leave their contact information for an agent. Contacting an airline via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook may be your best option right now. “My advice is to use technology,” he said. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. Are there any restrictions in place for people immigrating to the United States? + In April, President Trump ordered a temporary halt in issuing green cards. This order is in effect for 60 days, but might be extended “based on economic conditions at the time,” he said. Mr. Trump said that this order “will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis,” a reference to the worker visas, though he hinted that could change. “We want to protect our U.S. workers,” he said, “and I think as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.” Read More Trump’s temporary green card ban.

Politics and Government

Just for Parents

My kids are scared. What can I tell them? + Before you talk to your children, it’s important to understand your own anxiety and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota. Emphasize the importance of washing hands after using the bathroom and before or after meals. Children (and adults) should sing “Happy Birthday” twice to make sure they’ve been washing their hands for at least 20 seconds. You should also frame school cancellation as positive — more time to have more fun at home! — and encourage your children to get exercise. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. I’m worried about my children’s mental health. What can I do? + In some cases, exposure to stressful events — which right now might include the absence of routines, a parent’s job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness or death of someone a child cares about — can leave children feeling traumatized. When we see a child acting in a manner that we think is inappropriate, we need to consider that the child is outside her window of tolerance for stress. Monitor their behavior closely, and consider seeking counseling if you aren’t sure whether the stress response you’re seeing is normal. Talking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the harmful effects of stress. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem. Also, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved not to have to see other kids. Read More How to Keep Children’s Stress From Turning Into Trauma Can children get the coronavirus? Can they transmit it? + Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults. Their symptoms tend to be mild. However, a very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now. Read More Evidence that children may transmit the coronavirus. My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital? + No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. “We want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital,” said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langone’s Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital. If your child develops more severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink or a change in behavior, you should visit a doctor, Dr. Madan said. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. When can the grandparents come over? + A life in seemingly endless lockdown and isolation from grandchildren is not how grandparents want to spend their golden years. To start, families need their own reality check about the actual level of vigilance by every member of the household. So as a first step, think about human contacts, big and small, by every member of the household. How many times did someone go to a store? Did you meet up with a friend for a walk? When you jog, how close are you to other runners? And so on. Next, try to seal the “leaks” in your quarantine bubble. While it may be impossible to get your contact risk to zero, you can eliminate the biggest risks (like outside visitors), reduce shopping trips to once a week or less, improve hand hygiene and wear a mask. The biggest worry is being in an enclosed space with someone who has the virus but doesn’t know it, so keep everyone outside, if possible. But if a child must enter a grandparent’s house, monitor them and allow it only when the grandparent is outside. Everyone should wear a mask, and sanitize the bathroom after use. If the grandparent is visiting you, designate one disinfected bathroom just for them and keep children outdoors. Read More When Can I See My Grandkids? Should I take my child to her scheduled well visit? + If you have a newborn, toddler or young child who is still receiving immunizations, it is important to take her to her well visit, as long as you can do it safely, according to guidance released from the American Academy of Pediatrics on March 18. If your child is older and has received all of her immunizations, the A.A.P. recommends that you consider postponing your well visit for the near term. The organization also has tips for doctors to help keep their patients, parents and staff safe during their visits, including keeping well visits in the morning and restricting visits for kids who are sick to the afternoon. It also urges doctors to see kids who are sick in different facilities, rooms or floors, and to increase the use of telemedicine. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. Can we see other families at all? + “We’re really encouraging zero play dates at this point,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, M.D., an executive member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases. Theoretically, he said, it might be feasible for your child to play outside with one other child if they can keep six feet apart, but the reality is that keeping younger kids from touching their friends is nearly impossible. If you have an older child who you know can absolutely stay six feet apart from his pals in a wide open space, it’s fine for them to play, but monitor them closely. Always make sure they are washing hands vigorously when they come inside. Read More Have more questions? We asked experts. My kids can’t figure out how to play by themselves. + “In this time of anxiety and uncertainty, it’s really natural for children to regress, which means their dependency needs” — for comfort, physical closeness, affection and communication — “are going to be paramount,” said Lawrence J. Cohen, Ph.D., author of “Playful Parenting.” To get started, it helps to begin the day with some quality time playing together, for maybe 20 minutes. Then step aside and they might keep going. If they’re really not used to playing alone, they might only last for five or 10 minutes the first few times. It also helps “creating prompts for play time” around your home, arranging dolls at a tea party or putting together a half-built structure. Read More How to teach your kids to play on their own. Is all this screen time bad for my kids right now? + “Be gentle with yourself,” said Rhonda Moskowitz, founder of Practical Solutions Parent Coaching in Columbus, Ohio. “These are extreme times.” But it does help to think about what you’re comfortable and not comfortable with your kids doing and then creating some ground rules. Maybe it’s only certain activities they can do or a place they should do it (like in a common area so you can check-in). (Also keep in mind studies haven’t convincingly found measurable meaningful effects on young brains due to screen habits.)

It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. I’ve always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. And this is their new hoax. I’ve always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t. We’re — what do you have, a very small number of people in the country right now with it? It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape. We’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so if we could hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — it’s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000. We all together have done a very good job. The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. View this the same as the flu. This is not the flu. It’s vicious. It is so contagious. Flu has never been like that, and there is — flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what — the bottom line. Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. And in some cases, they’re in California where we have too many. And then in other cases, the distribution could be a little bit better for certain areas, but we’ve done a good job on testing.”	C.D.C.

Primaries and Caucuses

From the Iowa caucuses to Election Day, here is a look at which states vote when, and where the largest troves of delegates are at stake.

February 2020 Dem. Democratic Rep. Republican Iowa caucuses Because these are the first votes cast, there is a lot at stake in terms of momentum and attention from donors and the news media. The results here will winnow the field. 41 40 New Hampshire primaries Don't be surprised if only a few candidates are still standing after the votes are counted here. 24 22 Nevada Democratic caucuses Another key early state with a high-turnout caucus, and the first one with a significant Hispanic population. 36 South Carolina Democratic primary This state will offer the first real indication of the candidates’ strengths with black voters. 54 March 2020 Dem. Democratic Rep. Republican Alabama primaries Super Tuesday accounts for about one-third of total delegate allocation. 52 50 American Samoa Democratic caucus 6 Arkansas primaries 31 40 California primaries Because it has the largest delegate trove in the country, California is key to Super Tuesday. 415 172 Colorado primaries 67 34 Maine primaries 24 22 Massachusetts primaries 91 41 Minnesota primaries 75 39 North Carolina primaries 110 71 Oklahoma primaries 37 43 Tennessee primaries 64 58 Texas primaries * The third-largest delegate trove of the primary. 228 155 Utah primaries 29 40 Vermont primaries 16 17 Virginia Democratic primary 99 Democrats Abroad primary 13 Idaho primaries 20 32 Michigan primaries Midwestern powerhouses like Michigan will test the candidates’ appeal among suburbanites, African-Americans and working-class white voters.

Gabbard: I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately, negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today. Now, Senator Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president. But I’m deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.

She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California, and she fought to keep a cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.

Jake Tapper (moderator): Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Harris, your response?

Harris: As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done. And I am proud of that work. And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor but actually doing the work, of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform. That is why we created initiatives that were about re-entering former offenders and getting them counseling. It’s why, and because I know the criminal justice system is so broken, it is why I’m an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize but legalize marijuana in the United States.

Tapper: Thank you, Senator. I want to bring Congresswoman Gabbard back in.

Gabbard: The bottom line is, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not and worse yet in the case of those who are on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so. There’s no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor — you owe them an apology.

Tapper: Senator Harris?

Harris: My entire career, I have been personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who’s in a position to make that decision to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty. That is my background, that is my work. I am proud of it. I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it’s not about some fancy opinion on a stage, but when they’re in the position to actually make a decision what do they do, when I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty. History shows that and I am proud of those decisions."

trusted	The Death of Eric Garner, and the Events That Followed	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/04/nyregion/04garner-timeline.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	Staten Island Man Dies After Altercation With Police On a sidewalk a few blocks from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, the police try to arrest Eric Garner, 43, for selling loose cigarettes. Mr. Garner refuses, nonviolently, to be arrested. An officer puts him in a chokehold, a move forbidden under police rules. Mr. Garner dies. The encounter – including Mr. Garner repeating “I can’t breathe” as he is held down -- is captured on video by a bystander, who supplies it to The Daily News . Mayor 'Troubled' by Video Mayor Bill de Blasio says he is “very troubled” by the video. The two officers who first confronted Mr. Garner, including Daniel Pantaleo, who used the chokehold, are taken off patrol duty but continue to be paid. Studying Complaints About Chokeholds The independent Civilian Complaint Review Board says it is in the process of studying more than 1,000 complaints in recent years about police officers using chokeholds. Request for Investigation At Mr. Garner’s funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton announces that he and Mr. Garner’s family and their lawyers will ask federal prosecutors for a civil rights investigation. Death Classified as a Homicide The city medical examiner concludes that Mr. Garner died from the chokehold and the compression of his chest by officers. Mr. Garner’s death is classified a homicide -- meaning that he died at the hands of other persons, not that a crime was necessarily committed. Demonstrators Call for Criminal Charges Protesters outside the 120th Precinct station house in Staten Island and elsewhere call for local prosecutors to file criminal charges. In Ferguson, Mo., an unarmed black 18-year-old, Michael Brown, is fatally shot by a police officer during a confrontation. More than two weeks of riots, looting and other unrest ensue. Lawmakers Call for Federal Investigation Six Democratic members of Congress from New York City ask Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to open a federal investigation into Mr. Garner’s death. Grand Jury to Be Convened Staten Island’s district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., announces that he will convene a grand jury to hear possible charges against officers in the Garner case. A Peaceful March Thousands of protesters march peacefully near the site of Mr. Garner’s death. “We will not stop until somebody goes to jail,” David A. Paterson, the former governor of New York, tells the crowd. Wearable Video Cameras Police officials announce that some officers will start wearing video cameras to record every encounter, under an initiative begun long before the Garner case. Bratton Outlines Training Overhaul Police Commissioner William J. Bratton tells the City Council that officers have been too aggressive in minority neighborhoods and outlines an overhaul of police training. Claim of Intent Filed Mr. Garner’s family files a claim of intent to sue the city over his death. Man Shot and Killed in Housing Project Another unarmed black man is killed by a police officer: Akai Gurley, 28, is mistakenly shot in a darkened stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project by an officer who is on vertical patrol with his gun drawn. Officials Call Shooting 'Unfortunate Accident' City officials, hoping to defuse tension, name the officer in the shooting — an unusual step — and stress that Mr. Gurley was “a total innocent” and that the shooting was “an unfortunate accident.” No Indictment in Ferguson The grand jury in the Ferguson case declines to indict the officer who shot Michael Brown. Riots and looting occur in Missouri. protesters gather around the country, including in Times Square, where Mr. Bratton is spattered with fake blood . Protests Over Ferguson Decision Continue Protests against the Ferguson decision continue in New York, with thousands blocking traffic on busy streets, bridges and tunnels. Ten people are arrested.

The verdict sparked protests and condemnations outside the courthouse. Six officers were charged in Gray’s death, but only Officer Caesar Goodson was accused of murder. Gray was fatally injured after officers bound his hands and feet and Goodson left him unprotected by a seat belt that prosecutors say would have kept him from slamming into the van’s metal walls. Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams delivered his verdict Thursday after hearing five days of testimony in the non-jury trial. He found Goodson not guilty of “depraved-heart” murder, manslaughter, assault, misconduct in office, and reckless endangerment. Protests and rioting after Gray’s death on April 19, 2015 set the city on fire, forcing Maryland to bring in the National Guard. The unrest forced the city’s mayor to abandon her re-election campaign, and the Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations of widespread police abuse.

According to reports, Mr. Brown was walking down the middle of Canfield Drive with a friend, Dorian Johnson, when the officer stopped his Chevy Tahoe to order them to the sidewalk. Within seconds, the encounter turned into a physical struggle, as the officer and Mr. Brown became entangled through the open driver-side window of the police vehicle. How that encounter began is in dispute, though most accounts agree that shots were fired while the officer was in the vehicle. At some point, Mr. Brown broke away. The officer then got out of the vehicle and fired at Mr. Brown, whose actions at the point are also in dispute. Some witnesses later said that Mr. Brown appeared to be surrendering with his hands in the air as he was hit with the fatal gunshots. Others say that Mr. Brown was moving toward the officer when he was killed. What is not in dispute is that Mr. Brown was unarmed. His body would lie in the street for four hours. Angry Residents Take to the Streets Residents outraged by the shooting take to the streets, and a portion of West Florissant Avenue becomes a staging area for protests. “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace” become rallying cries. As early protests turn increasingly violent, the police respond with heavy-handed tactics – including military-style weapons and equipment -- that seem only to ratchet up the unrest. Eventually, both sides would make efforts to reduce the tension of the protests, which continued daily. F.B.I. Opens Civil Rights Investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation opens a civil rights inquiry into the shooting of Mr. Brown. A State Trooper Steps In Hours after President Obama denounces the actions of both police and protesters in Ferguson, Gov. Jay Nixon orders the Missouri State Highway Patrol to take over security operations. Alarm has been rising across the country at images of a mostly white police force, in a predominantly African-American community, aiming military-style weapons at protesters and firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Appointed by Mr. Nixon, Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the highway patrol immediately signals a change in approach. Troopers are ordered to remove tear-gas masks while armored vehicles and police cars are taken away. The tactics work for a short time before unrest returns. A curfew is later imposed. At times, Governor Nixon is jeered or shouted down as he tries to reassure residents and urge an end to the violence. Officer Involved in Shooting Is Identified Almost a week after the shooting of Mr. Brown, the officer who shot him is identified as Darren Wilson, who has five years of police experience. The release of the name is followed by series of incomplete accounts by Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief. These accounts sowed confusion about whether Officer Wilson knew that the teenager was a suspect in a robbery at a local convenience store that took place moments before the shooting. Brown's Family Releases Autopsy Details A preliminary private autopsy shows that Mr. Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Dr. Michael M. Baden, a former chief New York City medical examiner who conducted the autopsy for the family, says one bullet entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury. Dr. Baden says Mr. Brown was also shot four times in the right arm, and that all the bullets were fired into his front. This is the first time that some of the critical information resulting in Mr. Brown’s death has been made public, but the release of the preliminary autopsy results does little to explain the circumstances surrounding the shooting. National Guard Is Ordered to Ferguson After a curfew fails to quiet the streets, Governor Nixon brings in the National Guard, though in the limited role of protecting the police command post. Hours later, he lifts the curfew. The National Guard is ordered to withdraw in four days. Accounts of Shooting Differ As a county grand jury prepared to hear evidence, witnesses interviewed by investigators provide sharply conflicting accounts of the shooting. Some seem to agree on how the fatal altercation initially unfolded: with a struggle between Officer Wilson and Mr. Brown. Officer Wilson was inside his patrol car at the time, while Mr. Brown, who was unarmed, was leaning in through an open window. Many witnesses also agreed on what happened next: Officer Wilson’s firearm went off inside the car, Mr. Brown ran away, the officer got out of his car and began firing toward Mr. Brown, and then Mr. Brown stopped and turned to face the officer. But accounts of the crucial moments that followed differ sharply. Some witnesses say that Mr. Brown moved toward Officer Wilson, possibly in a threatening manner, when he was shot. Others say that Mr. Brown was not moving and that he might have even had his hands up. Protesters Descend on Ferguson Driven in part by posts on Twitter and other social media outlets, protesters from across the country descend on Ferguson, transforming a purely local protest into a center of national activism. The new protesters include rap and hip-hop stars as well as veterans of the Occupy Wall Street movement. While they are welcomed by some in Ferguson, others are deeply suspicious of their motives and question their behavior. Attorney General Arrives and Promises Full Inquiry Promising a full and fair investigation, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrives in St. Louis to meet with community leaders and federal investigators. While in Missouri, he tries to reassure Ferguson residents about the investigation into Michael Brown’s death and says he understands why many black Americans do not trust the police. While he promises a full inquiry, Mr. Holder also tries to temper expectations that charges will be filed. Mourning and Calls for Action at Brown's Funeral Thousands pay their respects to Mr. Brown. Infused with Scripture and song, the funeral is a mix of intimate reflections and national policy plans. Relatives reminisce in choked voices about Mr. Brown’s wide smile as a picture from his high school graduation flashes on two wide screens, as leaders urge those gathered to memorialize his life by carrying forward a vocal, strong and unified effort to seek change across the country. Justice Department Opens Inquiry The Justice Department announces that it will open a broad civil rights investigation that will examine whether the Ferguson police have a history of discrimination or misuse of force beyond the Michael Brown case. The inquiry is in addition to the F.B.I. civil rights investigation that is looking specifically into the shooting of Mr. Brown. Ferguson Leaders Try to Reach Out Responding to complaints that the Ferguson police are out of touch with the African-American community, the City Council agrees to establish a citizen review board to provide guidance. In addition, the council announces sweeping changes to its court system, which had been criticized as unfairly targeting low-income blacks, who had become trapped in a cycle of unpaid tickets and arrest warrants. Young black men in Ferguson and surrounding cities routinely find themselves passed from jail to jail as they are picked up on warrants for unpaid fines, one of the many simmering issues in the city. Ferguson Police Chief Apologizes Thomas Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, issues a stark apology to the family of Michael Brown, saying in a videotaped statement that he was sorry for the death of Mr. Brown and for the four hours that his body lay in the street after he was fatally shot. “I want to say this to the Brown family. No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you’re feeling,” he said, facing the camera and standing in front of an American flag. “I am truly sorry for the loss of your son. I’m also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day. But it was just too long, and I’m truly sorry for that.” A Shift in Police Oversight of Protests The St. Louis County Police Department takes control of security surrounding protests in Ferguson, Mo. Chief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson Police Department asked the county to step in, citing a “lack of manpower and resources” at the disposal of the relatively small Ferguson police force, said Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the county police. The Ferguson police had been criticized for their heavy-handed tactics in dealing with protesters. Call for Review of Police Tactics and Training Speaking to mayors and police chiefs gathered in Little Rock, Ark., Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. says the Justice Department is working with major police associations to conduct a broad review of policing tactics, techniques and training. The review is intended to “help the field swiftly confront emerging threats, better address persistent challenges, and thoroughly examine the latest tools and technologies to enhance the safety and the effectiveness of law enforcement.” Criticism of the Use of Military-Style Equipment by Police Images of violent clashes between officers in full body armor, with military-style equipment, pointing guns at residents in Ferguson protesting the shooting of Michael Brown, leads to calls for the demilitarization of local police forces around the country. At a Senate hearing in Washington, the Department of Homeland Security tried to ease criticism of the program by reminding lawmakers that the use of the equipment had been instrumental in the capture of suspects after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. A 'Weekend of Resistance' Thousands of people take part in events around the St. Louis area to protest the killing of Mr. Brown and to raise awareness of police treatment of African-Americans. During one event, some younger protesters, part of a group that had appeared night after night for sometimes rowdy protests, called out to the older faces on the stage, criticizing older activists for not being radical enough. During one protest, Cornell William Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., and the professor and author Cornel West were among 43 people arrested outside the Ferguson Police Department. Policeman Offers His Account Police Officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot Mr. Brown, tells investigators that he was pinned in his vehicle and in fear for his life as he struggled over his gun with Mr. Brown, said government officials briefed on the federal civil rights investigation. Officer Wilson, in the first public account of his testimony, says that Mr. Brown reached for the gun during a scuffle. The gun was fired twice in the car. Officer Wilson told the authorities that Mr. Brown had punched and scratched him repeatedly, leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck. The officer’s version contradicts some witness accounts, and does not explain why, after he emerged from his vehicle, he fired at Mr. Brown multiple times. Governor Activates National Guard Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency, allowing him to activate the Missouri National Guard in preparation for the grand jury's decision on whether to indict Officer Wilson. He also mobilized the National Guard in August. The declaration adds to the mounting tension over the announcement of the decision, which officials maintain is expected in mid- to late November. At this point, many in Ferguson say they expect the grand jury to decide against indicting the Ferguson officer, Darren Wilson, and they anticipate a show of anger and protest afterward. Some protesters say that calling up the Guard before a grand jury decision was an antagonistic move that presumed that demonstrations would be violent. “My hope and expectation is that peace will prevail,” Mr. Nixon said after announcing the decision. “But I have a responsibility to plan for any contingency that might arise.” No Charges Against Ferguson Officer in Michael Brown Shooting The grand jury decided to not indict Darren Wilson. Protesters have been mobilizing for weeks and the St. Louis area in general has been cloaked in anxiety for months as it has waited for a decision by the grand jury, which is made up of nine whites and three blacks.

In the two months that followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial profiling and flawed self-defense laws. “When they stop you, make sure you got your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.” Police did eventually arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of the fatal shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault. The case has reignited the national debate over racial violence. “I’m sure you saw the news about Ahmaud Arbery.” “It looks like murder.” “The American public saw the video.” What exactly happened in the last moments of Mr. Arbery’s life? Using security camera footage, cellphone video, and 911 calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed the critical 12 minutes from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla Drive to his death, less than 300 yards away. It’s around 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is out, less than 2 miles from his home. A security camera at 219 Satilla Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery enters the frame at around 1:04 p.m. He may have been jogging in the area, but he stops on the front lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being built across the street. Arbery glances around and wanders into the open construction site. Inside, security footage briefly captures him looking around. Meanwhile outside, a neighbor walks from Jones Road towards Satilla Drive and calls 911. The neighbor waits by the street corner. He will later tell the dispatcher that Arbery resembles a recent trespasser in the area. On multiple occasions before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught on camera at 220 Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On four occasions, what appears to be the same man was filmed. It’s unclear if this was Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify his shooting by neighbors outside on the street. The site’s owner says nothing was ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on Feb. 23, and no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of the trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in question. It’s 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street to 230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis and his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and leave the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don’t have footage showing the next 3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at the scene, and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate what happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto Burford Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in his car and follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery doubles back and passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but Arbery runs past him and toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael climbs from the cab to the bed of the truck armed with a handgun. We don’t know exactly what happens next. But Bryan and the McMichaels end up following Arbery on Holmes Road. And we next see Arbery at 1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes Road away from Roddy Bryan and toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is filming and — a warning — these scenes are distressing. Gregory McMichael dials 911 at this time. Let’s watch this back and break down what happens. This is Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles for almost 4 minutes. Travis is standing by the driver’s side of the truck, armed with a shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the 911 call. Arbery doesn’t know where to run. He veers right, then left and then darts around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes around the front of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the windshield and here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the instant the first shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right lung, ribs, and sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun. Gregory shouts: “Travis!” Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the truck, Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of frame. But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding. He throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the police report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon. He did not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting, and a minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew reports: Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground bleeding out. The police took Gregory McMichael’s testimony and let the two men go. But now the McMichaels both face serious charges. Hi, this is Malachy and I reported this story. For transparency, a note about the security footage used in this video, which was first published by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The time code you see here is incorrect. We know this because we lined up what we see in this video with what we hear in two 911 calls and we confirmed the time of those calls. These details and police logs also allowed us to determine that Gregory McMichael called 911 from his son’s phone just before the fatal shooting. So in this video, we used the real time that events happened. Thank you for watching.

They began creeping around and it created a deadly situation.” “My son, who was there to witness the event, you would think that, you know, he would show some type of sadness or emotions, but the first time I actually got to see him and pick him up from a facility for children, the first thing he told me was he was sad. And I asked him why was he sad. And he told me because the police had killed — had shot his aunt. And at that time, I knew nothing about that.

And our city’s hurt has gone even beyond the grief of the family that lost one of their own. Even as we wait for outside investigators to deliver their judgment on what took place, we have a pain now that reminds us that our community lives around a chasm. So at a time like this, I might point to all of the hard work we’ve done over seven years around things like police professionalism and accountability — things from bias and de-escalation to changing our approach to officer recruitment, training and promotion. But events compel me to acknowledge that whatever we’ve done has not been nearly enough. And if we do not tackle the problem of racial inequality in my lifetime, I am convinced that it will upend the American project in my lifetime. It brought our country to its knees once and if we do not act it could again. And so I believe this is not only a matter of justice, but a matter of national survival.

I am sure they’d love a word with the majority leader. The matter of reparations is one of making amends and direct redress, but it is also a question of citizenship. In H.R. 40, this body has a chance to both make good on its 2009 apology for enslavement and reject fair-weather patriotism.” “Putting aside the injustice of monetary reparations from current taxpayers for the sins of a small subset of Americans from many generations ago — let me finish — the fair distribution of reparations would be nearly impossible once one considers the complexity of the American struggle to abolish slavery. Just consider this. O.K. There are tens of millions of today’s non-African-Americans who are descended from people who arrived in the country, of course, after slavery ended, and therefore they can’t be held responsible for its legacy. More tens of millions are descended from people in both the North and South who didn’t own slaves or who were descended from white people who fought in the Civil War on the Union’s side. Indeed, only a small percentage of the total American population were slave owners.” “We as a nation have not yet truly acknowledged and grappled with racism and white supremacy that has tainted this country’s founding and continues to persist in those deep racial disparities and inequalities today. This is a very important hearing. It is historic. It is urgent.” “Black people don’t need another apology. We need safer neighborhoods and better schools. We need a less punitive criminal justice system. We need affordable health care, and none of these things can be achieved through reparations for slavery.” “It is only this group that can singularly— singularly — claim to have been slaves under the auspices, the institution and leadership of the United States government.

The director John Singleton was 51 years old. His family took him off life support after he had a stroke earlier this month. He’s best known as the director and screenwriter of “Boyz N the Hood,” a coming-of-age story of three black teenagers in South Central Los Angeles. “Wait a minute — hey. Man, this is family business.” The film earned him an Oscar nomination for best director, becoming the first African-American nominee, as well as the youngest, in that category. He was also nominated for best original screenplay. His hometown of Los Angeles featured prominently in many of his films. “You know, at film school they always teach you write about what you know. And I was like, wow, you know, this is what I know. This is where I’m from. So, I can do something different. I can make something that is really about where we’re from in South Central Los Angeles.” Singleton took an early interest in film during his younger years. “My mother used to take my little rolls of film to the lab and get them made for me — developed for me in high school. So, I wouldn’t be — I wouldn’t be where I am if it wasn’t for my mother. Growing up, he was influenced by “Cooley High” and Spike Lee’s “She’s Gotta Have It.” After “Boyz N the Hood,” he would go on to direct in a variety of genres. He went on to inspire and mentor many African-American filmmakers and actors.

A lot of people in the medical community live very privileged lives, so racism isn’t a reality to them. When someone comes in and talks to them, it might sound like a fairy tale, rather than a real daily struggle that people are dealing with. Research shows that African-Americans, for example, are optimistic when they start therapy, but within a few sessions feel less optimistic and have high early dropout rates. It could be that clinicians don’t know how to address their problems, or they may even be saying things that are subtly racist that may drive their clients away. If the patient feels misunderstood or even insulted by the therapist and they don’t go back and get help, they end up suffering for years or even the rest of their lives for something that is very treatable.

After many demands to drop a gun, Officer Brentley Vinson, 26, opens fire, and Mr. Scott staggers and falls.

The police last week released extended versions of two Oct. 4 videos in which officers can be heard talking about “the gun.” The police said Mr. Scott was holding one when he was shot, but his family has continued to argue that he was not.

On Oct. 12, the family’s lawyer, Charles Monnett, suggested that if there was a gun, it might have been in an ankle holster the police found at the scene. None of the videos, including those just released, conclusively answer the questions about the gun. Here is what they do show.

Key Moments in the Confrontation

43 seconds before shooting

A dark minivan and a dark S.U.V. are parked, doors open, blocking the white S.U.V. in which Mr. Scott is sitting, windows rolled up. The officer in the red shirt can be seen behind a nearby pickup with his gun drawn and pointed. Three other officers are at the scene, all in bulletproof vests.

“Drop the gun,” an officer says, as a uniformed officer arrives in a marked S.U.V. He is equipped with a body camera, and there is a dashboard camera in his car.

39 seconds before shooting

“Don’t shoot him, don’t shoot him,” says Rakeyia Scott, Mr. Scott’s wife, who is recording with a cellphone, as the police continue to demand that Mr. Scott drop a gun.

30 seconds before shooting

“He doesn’t have a gun,” Ms. Scott says. “He has a T.B.I.” — a traumatic brain injury Mr. Scott suffered in a motorcycle accident in November. “He’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine.”

25 seconds before shooting

An officer is visible standing behind the minivan, pointing his gun.

“Let me get a [expletive] baton over here,” an officer says. “Keith, don’t let them break the windows,” his wife pleads. “Come on out the car.”

16 seconds before shooting

The officer with the body camera moves behind Mr. Scott’s S.U.V. to the passenger side, where another officer in a white shirt can now be clearly seen standing a few steps from the vehicle, aiming his gun point-blank at the passenger-side window.

An officer, possibly Officer Vinson, who the police said fired the fatal shots, is seen standing at the front of the minivan, aiming at Mr. Scott, who walks backward, looking to his right. His arms are down, but the images are not sharp enough to clearly establish whether he is holding a gun.

During the extended body-camera video, officers can be seen working on Mr. Scott’s wounds. During that time, one officer orders another to “stay here with the gun.”

The police released a photo of a gun near an evidence tag on a blacktop surface that they said was found at the scene. The police said the gun had traces of Mr. Scott’s DNA. They also said the gun had been stolen, and sold illegally to Mr. Scott.

Ms. Bland has a right to smoke in her car, but Trooper Encinia could argue that the cigarette was interfering with legitimate police business. Since he had already processed the papers, however, “I don’t see a good reason,” said Robert Weisberg, a criminal procedure expert and law professor at Stanford University. During a traffic stop, a police officer has the right to ask a driver to get out of the car even for a non-arrestable offense, as a way of securing his own safety. The officer has almost complete discretion and the driver is legally obligated to get out when asked. “He has control over the location of drivers,” Mr. Weisberg said. “It is equal to an officer patting you down to see if you have a gun.” In this case, Mr. Weisberg said, there is no evidence that Trooper Encinia feared for his safety. He would have to argue that Ms. Bland’s refusal to put the cigarette out gave him the impression that she was violent.

The police narrative is contradicted by what is shown in the video.

A police statement released just after the shooting said Mr. McDonald refused to drop a knife and “continued to approach officers.” A police union spokesman said the teenager was “coming at the officer.”

The video shows Mr. McDonald several feet away from Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot him 16 times. Mr. McDonald does not appear to be moving toward the officer when he opened fire. The shooting appears to continue as Mr. McDonald was lying on the pavement.

OFFICERS MCDONALD Mr. McDonald appears to walk away from officers.

Officer Van Dyke gets ready to shoot.

Mr. McDonald is shot 16 times.

It took 13 months before the city released the video.

Despite numerous requests from the media for the video’s release, the city fought to keep it private, citing a federal investigation into the shooting. It was not until a county judge ordered its release in November that the video became public. Officer Van Dyke was charged with murder hours before the video was released.

The N.A.A.C.P. called it “unacceptable” that it took over a year for the video to be released. Anita Alvarez, the Cook County state’s attorney, defended the delay, saying investigations into police shootings often take more than a year.

Critics say there is evidence of a cover-up by the police department.

Workers at a nearby Burger King said that police arrived soon after the shooting and reviewed surveillance video from the restaurant. Later, about 80 minutes of footage during the shooting seemed to have mysteriously vanished.

The Cook County state’s attorney said there was no evidence to prove tampering and that the camera would not have captured the shooting anyway.

No conversations between police officers can be heard on the videos released by the city. A Chicago police department rule requires that audio and video are recorded whenever the car’s emergency-roof lights are activated. Police said the absence of discernible audio was most likely a technical glitch.

But their jerky and limited perspectives and low resolution make the fast-moving events difficult to follow. Here, based on a synchronized, frame-by-frame analysis of the videos, is a depiction of what is known about what happened.

Two unmarked cars are trapping Mr. Scott’s white sport-utility vehicle in its parking space. 7 seconds before shooting The uniformed officer has run behind Mr. Scott’s vehicle to the passenger side, and is trying to break the passenger-side window with his baton. At this point, Mr. Scott opens the driver’s door. Shooting starts Mr. Scott has backed away from his car. After many demands to drop a gun, Officer Brentley Vinson, 26, opens fire, and Mr. Scott staggers and falls.

The police last week released extended versions of two Oct. 4 videos in which officers can be heard talking about “the gun.” The police said Mr. Scott was holding one when he was shot, but his family has continued to argue that he was not.

On Oct. 12, the family’s lawyer, Charles Monnett, suggested that if there was a gun, it might have been in an ankle holster the police found at the scene. None of the videos, including those just released, conclusively answer the questions about the gun. Here is what they do show.

Key Moments in the Confrontation

43 seconds before shooting

A dark minivan and a dark S.U.V. are parked, doors open, blocking the white S.U.V. in which Mr. Scott is sitting, windows rolled up. The officer in the red shirt can be seen behind a nearby pickup with his gun drawn and pointed. Three other officers are at the scene, all in bulletproof vests.

“Drop the gun,” an officer says, as a uniformed officer arrives in a marked S.U.V. He is equipped with a body camera, and there is a dashboard camera in his car.

39 seconds before shooting

“Don’t shoot him, don’t shoot him,” says Rakeyia Scott, Mr. Scott’s wife, who is recording with a cellphone, as the police continue to demand that Mr. Scott drop a gun.

30 seconds before shooting

“He doesn’t have a gun,” Ms. Scott says. “He has a T.B.I.” — a traumatic brain injury Mr. Scott suffered in a motorcycle accident in November. “He’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine.”

25 seconds before shooting

An officer is visible standing behind the minivan, pointing his gun.

“Let me get a [expletive] baton over here,” an officer says. “Keith, don’t let them break the windows,” his wife pleads. “Come on out the car.”

16 seconds before shooting

The officer with the body camera moves behind Mr. Scott’s S.U.V. to the passenger side, where another officer in a white shirt can now be clearly seen standing a few steps from the vehicle, aiming his gun point-blank at the passenger-side window.

1 second before shooting

An officer, possibly Officer Vinson, who the police said fired the fatal shots, is seen standing at the front of the minivan, aiming at Mr. Scott, who walks backward, looking to his right. His arms are down, but the images are not sharp enough to clearly establish whether he is holding a gun.

During the extended body-camera video, officers can be seen working on Mr. Scott’s wounds. During that time, one officer orders another to “stay here with the gun.”

The police released a photo of a gun near an evidence tag on a blacktop surface that they said was found at the scene. The police said the gun had traces of Mr. Scott’s DNA. They also said the gun had been stolen, and sold illegally to Mr. Scott.

Ms. Bland has a right to smoke in her car, but Trooper Encinia could argue that the cigarette was interfering with legitimate police business. Since he had already processed the papers, however, “I don’t see a good reason,” said Robert Weisberg, a criminal procedure expert and law professor at Stanford University. During a traffic stop, a police officer has the right to ask a driver to get out of the car even for a non-arrestable offense, as a way of securing his own safety. The officer has almost complete discretion and the driver is legally obligated to get out when asked. “He has control over the location of drivers,” Mr. Weisberg said. “It is equal to an officer patting you down to see if you have a gun.” In this case, Mr. Weisberg said, there is no evidence that Trooper Encinia feared for his safety. He would have to argue that Ms. Bland’s refusal to put the cigarette out gave him the impression that she was violent. If Trooper Encinia had feared for his safety, he would not have walked away from the car for five minutes, Mr. Weisberg said."	Assessing the Legality of Sandra Bland’s Arrest	2015-07-20	['K.K.

trusted	Comments	true	[]		trusted	[]	http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/site/usercontent/usercontent.html	http://www.nytimes.com/	"1. What kind of comments are you looking for? We are interested in articulate, well-informed remarks that are relevant to the article. We welcome your advice, your criticism and your unique insights into the issues of the day.

To be approved for publication, your comments should be civil and avoid name-calling. Our standards for taste are reflected in the articles we publish in the newspaper and on NYTimes.com; we expect your comments to follow that example. A few things we won't tolerate: personal attacks, obscenity, vulgarity, profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes), commercial promotion, impersonations, incoherence and SHOUTING.

2. Why do you moderate readers' comments? Our goal is to provide substantive commentary for a general readership. By screening submissions, we have created a space where readers can exchange intelligent and informed commentary that enhances the quality of our news and information.

While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective. Our Community desk will make them as carefully and consistently as we can. Because of the volume of reader comments, we cannot review individual moderation decisions with readers and generally cannot alter a comment once it is posted. Learn more about how we moderate reader comments.

3. How do I write a comment? The first time you write a comment, you will be asked to complete a quick registration process. It should take you no more than one minute.

You will be asked for a display name and your location. Both of these items will be displayed publicly on NYTimes.com. If you are writing a comment, please be thoughtful, civil and articulate. In the vast majority of cases, we only accept comments written in English; foreign language comments will be rejected.

4. Why are comments closed on an article? The vast majority of comments are reviewed by a human moderator. Because of this, the number of comments that we are capable of moderating each day is limited. Typically, comment threads are open for 24 hours. After that point, we move to newer news. It is unfortunate that some of these discussions do not have the chance to further evolve, but the benefit is that we're able to host a civil comments section.

5. Why do I have to register? We ask you to complete the simple NYTimes.com registration process to ensure that you are a ""real"" person and that you accept our terms and conditions. The registration process serves to facilitate the development of our online community, and ensure that members take responsibility for their writings.

6. When and where will my comment be published? Since comments are moderated, they do not appear on the site until they have been approved. Comments are typically posted faster during business hours. Moderation can be less frequent in the evening and on weekends. We reserve the right to display comments in a variety of ways, including within the text of articles or in advertisements.

7. Do you edit comments? No. Comments are either approved or rejected. We reserve the right to edit a comment that is quoted or excerpted on NYTimes.com or on our affiliate blogs. In those cases, we may fix spelling, grammar or punctuation.

8. What are NYT Picks? NYT Picks are a selection of comments that represent a range of views and are judged the most interesting or thoughtful. In some cases, NYT Picks may be selected to highlight comments from a particular region, or readers with first-hand knowledge of an issue.

9. I found an inappropriate comment. What do I do? Click Flag at the bottom right of a comment, select the reasons you believe it should be removed and submit the report. If you suspect that a comment has been posted by a political propaganda network or contains deliberate misinformation, please flag that comment for spam. Flagged comments are never automatically removed from the site. Flagged comments will be further reviewed by the Community desk.

10. Should I use my real name and location when making a comment? Using your real name is not required. We understand that many readers do not wish to be publicly identified, and we support your desire to protect your privacy. However, your location will help our journalists make sure that your comments are properly promoted in articles that concern your region. We recommend against posting your full email address, for security reasons.

A reminder: Once your comment is published, it can be found in search results on websites like Google and Yahoo. A New York Times staffer may occasionally use the email address you have listed in the My Account area for a follow-up interview. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.

11. What about criticism of The Times? We welcome strong opinions and criticism of our work, and do not hesitate to approve critical comments. However, personal attacks against our staff will not be permitted, and any criticism should relate to the article in question. Generally, we will not allow comments to become bogged down with discussions of our moderation policies, and we will moderate accordingly.

12. Why didn't I get my confirmation email? The confirmation email is sent automatically, but it may take a little while before it arrives in your Inbox. Also, you may want to make sure that we have your current email address associated with your registration. In addition, please be sure that the email notification checkbox underneath the comment submission form is selected for each of your submissions.

If you think you are having problems receiving email from NYTimes.com, please contact Customer Care.

13. Can I use a different display name for some comments? You are free to change your display name. However, in the future, these changes may apply to your previous comments.

14. Should I post new information about a breaking news story? What if I see an error in an article? What is the best way to suggest a correction? We appreciate it when readers and people quoted in articles point out errors of fact or emphasis and will investigate all assertions. These suggestions should be sent via email. To avoid distracting other readers, we won't publish comments that suggest a correction. Instead, corrections will be made in a blog post or at the top of an article, and also can be found on the main Corrections page.

To send a message about news coverage, email nytnews@nytimes.com or call toll-free at 800-NYTIMES (800-698-4637). Comments on editorials may be emailed to letters@nytimes.com or faxed to 212-556-3622."

The term ""digital product"" refers to paid digital products available from NYTimes, including both NYTimes digital subscriptions and one-time purchases.

1.2. About Digital Products

You are not required to purchase anything for certain limited use of NYTimes.com or the NYTimes apps. However, if you do not purchase a subscription or product, your access to NYTimes content and services will be limited.

You can review the various NYTimes digital subscriptions here. We also offer other products and services, such as crosswords, gift subscriptions, e-books and articles from our archive. The purchase of a gift subscription is a one-time purchase; for more information, see the Gift Subscriptions FAQ.

The New York Times reserves the right to modify the content, type and availability of any digital product at any time.

Only one person may use the user name and password associated with a digital product account.

For details about your purchases, including payment methods and billing cycles, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com.

1.3. Processing and Payment

The New York Times will process your purchase as promptly as possible. There may be a delay in the activation of your product while payment details are verified.

We accept major credit cards, PayPal and certain digital wallet services. We reserve the right to reject any order or purchase at any time.

If your initial payment authorization is later revoked, your subscription, product or access will be terminated. Contact our Customer Care group if you believe your access was terminated in error.

Unless specified otherwise in the Cancellation and Refund Policy, all charges are nonrefundable.

To view or change your payment method, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com.

1.4. Pricing

When you purchase a digital product, the price will be made clear during the order process. You agree to pay the price that is stated at the time of your order, as well as any applicable taxes. You also agree to the billing frequency stated at the time of your order.

Discount eligibility is determined at the time of the order. Discounts cannot be applied retroactively.

All prices are in United States Dollars, unless otherwise stated.

The New York Times reserves the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the regular rate of a product changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to accept the new price or cancel your subscription or purchase from that point forward.

Applicable taxes may vary. We are not able to notify you in advance of changes in applicable taxes.

If a stated price is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the product at that price. We will notify you of the error and give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.

Additional Costs

Your subscription may not include access to all areas of the digital product, and you may have to pay additional fees for full access. These additional charges will be clearly stated.

When you use your digital product, you may incur other additional charges from third party service providers, such as telecommunications fees, data fees or service provider fees. You are responsible for paying any additional charges.

If you believe someone else has used your account or you are being charged for a product you do not have, please contact our Customer Care group.

1.5. Billing

1.5.1. Billing of Digital Subscriptions

We will charge or debit your payment method at the beginning of your subscription or, if applicable, at the end of your free trial period. Billing will continue according to the cycle stated at the time of your order.

To view information about your billing cycle, visit the My Account area of NYTimes.com.

All NYTimes digital subscriptions are renewed automatically. When we renew your subscription, we will use the payment method currently associated with your account. If you redeem a gift subscription and choose to extend your subscription at the time of redemption, that subscription will renew automatically. You can view your payment method at any time in the My Account area of NYTimes.com.

In most cases, you will not be notified in advance of impending renewals and you expressly agree to waive the application of New York General Obligations Law section 5-903 and any similar laws. Please see our Cancellation and Refund policy below for information about canceling.

1.5.2. Billing of One-Time Purchases

When you make a one-time purchase (for example, a subscription sponsorship or standalone product such as an article from our archives or a gift subscription), we will charge or debit your payment method at the time of purchase.

1.5.3. Currency

The currency in which you will be billed will be stated during the purchase process and is determined based on your billing address.

1.6. Unpaid Charges

If your credit card expires or your payment method is otherwise invalid, your subscription or product will not automatically be terminated. You will remain responsible for all charges.

You will be responsible for all costs we incur in connection with the collection of unpaid amounts, including court costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated costs.

1.7. Promotions

We may occasionally offer promotions. The specific terms of each promotion are stated at the time the promotion is offered. Each promotion may be different. Promotions cannot be combined.

You are required to provide your payment details when you sign up for a promotion. At the end of the promotion, your subscription will automatically renew at the rates displayed at the time of purchase.

We will not notify you in advance that the promotion is about to end and we will not notify you when your promotional rate has ended. To cancel and avoid being charged, you must notify us before the promotion ends.

1.8. Software Products

If you purchase a digital subscription that includes downloadable software, your download and use of that software may be subject to additional terms or end user license agreements.

1.9. Third Parties

If you have purchased your product through a third party, these Terms of Sale may not apply to you. We are not liable to you for any claims related to purchases made through third parties. Please contact the third party directly.

trusted	Killing Khashoggi: How a Brutal Saudi Hit Job Unfolded	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006154117/khashoggi-istanbul-death-saudi-consulate.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	There were 15 of them. Most arrived in the dead of night, laid their trap and waited for the target to arrive. That target was Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic of his country’s government and its young crown prince. Since his killing in Istanbul, Turkish media has released a steady drip feed of evidence implicating Saudi officials. Weeks of investigation by The Times builds on that evidence and reconstructs what unfolded, hour-by-hour. Our timeline shows the ruthless efficiency of a hit team of experts that seemed specially chosen from Saudi government ministries. Some had links to the crown prince himself. After a series of shifting explanations, Saudi Arabia now denies that this brazen hit job was premeditated. But this reconstruction of the killing, and the botched cover-up, calls their story into serious question. It’s Friday morning, Sept. 28. Khashoggi and his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, are at the local marriage office in Istanbul. In order to marry, he’s told that he needs Saudi paperwork and goes straight to the consulate to arrange it. They tell him to return in a week. It all seems routine, but it’s not. Inside there’s a Saudi spy, Ahmed al-Muzaini, who’s working under diplomatic cover. That very day, he flies off to Riyadh and helps concoct a plan to intercept Khashoggi when he returns to the consulate. Fast-forward to Monday night into Tuesday morning. Saudi agents converge in Istanbul aboard separate flights. Muzaini, the spy, flies back from Riyadh. A commercial flight carries a three-man team that we believe flew from Cairo. Two of the men are security officers and they’ve previously traveled with the crown prince. A private jet flying from Riyadh lands around 3:30 a.m. That plane is often used by the Saudi government, and it’s carrying nine Saudi officials, some who played key roles in Khashoggi’s death. We’ll get to Team 3 later on, and for now focus on these men from Team 2. This is Salah al-Tubaigy, a high-ranking forensics and autopsy expert in the Saudi interior ministry. Turkish officials will later say his role was to dismember Khashoggi’s body. Another is Mustafa al-Madani, a 57-year-old engineer. As we’ll see, it’s no accident that he looks like Khashoggi. And this is Maher Mutreb, the leader of the operation. Our investigation into his past reveals a direct link between Mutreb and the Saudi crown prince. When bin Salman toured a Houston neighborhood earlier this year, we discovered that Mutreb was with him, a glowering figure in the background. We found him again in Boston, at a U.N. meeting in New York, in Madrid and Paris, too. This global tour was all part of a charm offensive by the prince to paint himself as a moderate reformer. Back then, Mutreb was in the royal guard. Now, he would orchestrate Khashoggi’s killing. And his close ties to the crown prince beg the question, just how high up the Saudi chain of command did the plot to kill go? Early Tuesday morning, Khashoggi flies back from a weekend trip to London. He and the Saudis nearly cross paths at the airport. The Saudi teams check into two hotels, which give quick access to the consulate. Khashoggi heads home with his fiancée. He’d just bought an apartment for their new life together. By mid-morning, the Saudis are on the move. Mutreb leaves his hotel three hours before Khashoggi is due at the consulate. The rest of the team isn’t far behind. The building is only a few minutes away on foot, and soon, they’re spotted at this entrance. Mutreb arrives first. Next, we see al-Tubaigy, the autopsy expert. And now al-Madani, the lookalike. The stage is almost set. A diplomatic car pulls out of the consulate driveway and switches places with a van, which backs in. Turkish officials say this van would eventually carry away Khashoggi’s remains. From above, we can see the driveway is covered, hiding any activity around the van from public view. Meanwhile, Khashoggi and his fiancée set out for the consulate, walking hand-in-hand. In their final hour together, they chat about dinner plans and new furniture for their home. At 1:13 p.m., they arrive at the consulate. Khashoggi gives her his cellphones before he enters. He walks into the consulate. It’s the last time we see him. Inside, Khashoggi is brought to the consul general’s office on the second floor. The hit team is waiting in a nearby room. Sources briefed on the evidence, told us Khashoggi quickly comes under attack. He’s dragged to another room and is killed within minutes. Then al-Tubaigy, the autopsy expert, dismembers his body while listening to music. Maher Mutreb makes a phone call to a superior. He says, “Tell your boss,” and “The deed was done.” Outside, the van reportedly carrying Khashoggi’s body pulls out of the side entrance and drives away. At the same time, the Saudis begin trying to cover their tracks. While Khashoggi’s fiancée waits here where she left him, two figures leave from the opposite side. One of them is wearing his clothes. Later, the Saudis would claim that this was Khashoggi. But it’s al-Madani, the engineer, now a body double pretending that the missing journalist left the consulate alive. Yet there’s one glaring flaw: The clothes are the same, but he’s wearing his own sneakers, the ones he walked in with. Meanwhile, the van that’s allegedly carrying Khashoggi’s body makes the two-minute drive from the consulate to the Saudi consul’s residence. There’s several minutes of deliberations but the van eventually pulls into the building’s driveway. Again, it’s hidden from public view. It’s now three hours since Khashoggi was last seen. The body double hails this taxi and continues weaving a false trail through the city. He heads to a popular tourist area and then changes back into his own clothes. Later, we see him joking around in surveillance footage. Over at the airport, more Saudi officials arrive on another flight from Riyadh. They spend just five hours in Istanbul, but we’re not sure where they go. Now we pick up Maher Mutreb again, exiting from the consul’s house. It’s time for them to go. Mutreb and others check out of their hotel and move through airport security. Al-Muzaini, the spy, heads to the airport too. But as they’re leaving Istanbul, Khashoggi’s fiancée is still outside the consulate, pacing in circles. She’ll soon raise the alarm that Khashoggi is missing and she’ll wait for him until midnight. The alarm spreads around the world. Nine days later, the Saudis send another team to Istanbul. They say it’s to investigate what happened. But among them are a toxicologist and a chemist, who also has ties to the hit team. He and Tubaigy attended a forensics graduation days before Khashoggi was killed. Turkish officials later say that this team’s mission was not to investigate, but to cover up the killing. Now the Saudi story has changed, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for several suspects in Khashoggi’s killing. But that doesn’t include Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who many Western government officials are convinced authorized the killing. Khashoggi’s remains still haven’t been found.

trusted	How Did Iran’s Qassim Suleimani Wield Power? We Tracked the Quds Force Playbook	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006906161/suleimani-quds-iran.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	Before he was killed in a U.S. drone strike, Iranian general Qassim Suleimani was showing up everywhere — in Aleppo, Baghdad, Beirut, with Iran’s leader, with Iraq’s former prime minister. It wasn’t always this way. For years, Suleimani was an under-the-radar operator in the Middle East. He ran an elite military unit called the Quds Force. It’s an arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps that works to expand Iran’s influence in the Middle East using covert military and intelligence tactics. But in 2014, things started to change. The elusive commander was spotted in the public eye more often. We started seeing him with militias, on battlefields, at funerals. He even had his own Instagram. We combed through hundreds of images and videos, many of them propaganda from Suleimani’s early military days to his recent stint as a social media sensation. These appearances help paint a more complete picture of how the Quds Force operates, through a network of proxy forces, or local militias, along a key corridor that Iran calls the “axis of resistance.” It stretches through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon. Let’s start in Lebanon. These are rare images that appear to have been taken very recently. They show Suleimani with Hassan Nasrallah, who is the leader of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based militant group. Hezbollah is the archetype for how the Quds Force operates. They helped found the group and fund it to this day. This support fueled Hezbollah’s rise as a political party, and as a military threat to Israel, Iran’s archenemy. These are Hezbollah fighters posing with Iranian weapons. and here’s a video of Suleimani with a senior commander of Hezbollah. The group gives Iran a key foothold in the region, along this corridor we told you about. This photo from 2013 reveals just how strong the bond is between these two groups. It shows a prominent Hezbollah member at a funeral for Suleimani’s mother in Tehran. Two years later, that Hezbollah member died, and Suleimani himself made the trip to Beirut to pay his respects. He’s seen here praying at his grave. Now let’s look at how Suleimani took the Hezbollah playbook and mimicked it in Iraq. Here, too, sightings of Suleimani help tell the story. Here he is in 2015 with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of an Iraq-based militia called Kataib Hezbollah, also known as K.H. Over the last few years, the two were seen frequently together, and the bond is strong here, too, judging by this propaganda video. Similar to Hezbollah, K.H. is active in politics and helped push Iran’s interests in Baghdad. And it runs military operations. Suleimani’s team trains and arms them, and one of their main targets over the years has been American forces. We found propaganda footage of K.H. attacks on American bases in Iraq. And K.H. also joined the fight against ISIS, which Iran considered a major threat. In fact, Suleimani even shows up at victories against ISIS in Iraq. These were brutal campaigns, where civilians were often collateral damage. K.H. would later be seen during the recent attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That episode led up to Suleimani’s killing, and the other senior commander to die in the attack was none other than K.H.’s leader: Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The next place we see Suleimani is Syria, the missing piece in Iran’s strategic corridor. The militias we just told you about, Hezbollah and K.H., here they are in Syria, fighting to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stay in power. Syria was also the only place we actually saw Iranian operatives besides Suleimani in action. Here, one of them describes how they train fighters in Syria. But this video wasn’t meant to be released. The footage was captured and leaked by Syrian opposition forces. Remember, it’s all part of the playbook. Iranian Quds Force fighters rarely appeared in any of the videos we found. They stay under the radar and do most of their work through proxies. But we still see Suleimani. Here he is near Aleppo in 2015. The eventual fall of Aleppo became a key turning point for Assad, with devastating consequences for civilians. One big winner in all this bloodshed was Iran, which kept its foothold in Syria. There’s another place on the map, Yemen, where Iran is active, but we don’t see Suleimani here. Why? Because Iran doesn’t want to be linked directly to the conflict. We do see other clues. These are Iranian weapons being used by a group called the Houthis. They’re fighting against forces backed by Iran’s great rival, Saudi Arabia. And Suleimani’s lack of public profile here tells us one final thing about the Quds Force: controlling whether they come out of or remain in the shadows is all part of their game.

All 176 people on board were killed. To find out what happened to Flight 752 after it left Tehran airport on Jan. 8, we collected flight data, analyzed witness videos and images of the crash site, to paint the clearest picture yet of that disastrous seven-minute flight. We’ll walk you through the evidence, minute by minute, from the plane’s takeoff to the moment it crashed. It’s the early hours of Wednesday, Jan. 8. Iran has just launched ballistic missiles at U.S. military targets in Iraq in retaliation for an American drone strike that killed Iranian military leader Qassim Suleimani. Iranian defenses are on high alert, on guard for a possible U.S. attack. Four hours later, at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Flight 752, operated by Ukraine International Airlines, is getting ready for departure. At 6:12 a.m., the plane takes off. It flies northwest, and climbs to almost 8,000 feet in around three minutes, according to flight tracker data. It’s following its regular route. Up ahead are several military sites. Until now, the plane’s transponder has been signaling normally. But just before 6:15 a.m., it stops. This is where the first missile hits the plane. Footage from a security camera near one of the military sites shows the missile launch. It hits the plane, and knocks out the transponder. But the airliner keeps flying. A security camera, directly beneath, shows what happens next. A second missile launches 30 seconds after the first, and it explodes, moments later. A third video shows the impact. Let’s watch it again, and slow it down. Here is the missile, and here is the plane. An Iranian military commander said a defense system operator mistook the passenger jet for a cruise missile. The plane is now on fire. We don’t know its precise path after 6:15 a.m., but we do know that it turns back in the direction of the airport. It continues flying for several minutes, engulfed by flames. Around 6:19 a.m., a bystander films the plane slowly going down. There appears to be second explosion before the jetliner plummets outside Tehran about 10 miles from where the last signal was sent. A security camera captures that moment as the plane crashes toward it. Here we see the immediate aftermath of the crash. As day breaks, another witness films the smoldering wreckage. Debris is spread out over 1,500 feet along a small park, orchards and a soccer field, narrowly missing a nearby village. A large section of the plane looks badly charred. More jet parts are found here, and the plane’s tail and wheels land over 500 feet away. It is a gruesome scene. The passengers’ personal items — toys, clothes, photo albums — are scattered around. After days of denials, Iran took responsibility for the crash, blaming human error at a moment of heightened tensions.

trusted	Secret Video Offers Rare Look Inside Chinese Labor Program	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006874372/chinese-labor-uighurs.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	In a far corner of northwestern China, a car drives along a wall lined with barbed wire, heading towards what looks like a standard apartment complex. Access here is restricted, and the cameraperson is filming secretly … … because this is no ordinary residence. It’s part of a contentious labor resettlement program run by the Chinese government to extend state control over Muslim minorities, mostly Uighurs, by moving them from one part of China to work in another. This covert, low-quality footage that we’ve adjusted to reveal some details, and obscure others, gives us some rare insights into how people in this program live and are indoctrinated. Over the last few years, the mass incarceration of more than a million Uighurs and Kazakhs by the Chinese government has led to international outrage. These labor programs are part of that larger story. Let’s take a closer look at the compound we showed you at the beginning. It’s in Xinjiang, in the northern city of Kuitun, where the population is mostly China’s Han ethnic majority. But the workers in the compound are Uighurs, and other minorities transferred there from their homes in Hotan and Kashgar, hundreds of miles away. At the Kuitun complex there are multiple dormitories. We see that right around the time the transfer started in 2017, a security checkpoint and another building, a cafeteria, were built at the site. The cameraperson is now shooting inside of the cafeteria. We can see the compound’s residents. They all work as street cleaners. A sign describing the program calls them Kashgar and Hotan surplus labor. It also lists instructions for how they should conduct themselves. And another poster offers guidelines on how to interact with the local population. This program and others like it have led to the relocation of hundreds of thousands of Uighurs away from their homes and families. But government propaganda openly promotes these as poverty alleviation initiatives. What’s at stake here is about more than just putting people into labor programs. The bigger goal is to turn Uighurs and other ethnic minorities away from their own heritage, to be more in line with the rest of Communist China. Back at the compound, the rules strictly limit when and where the workers can go. We hear about this as a cameraperson meets residents in the sleeping quarters. This man was pressured to come here a year earlier, leaving his family, a wife and young child, behind. His life here includes mandatory Mandarin classes in the evenings. And despite the government’s claim that they are lifting these workers out of poverty, he says he’s only making a third of what he did back home. Yarkand County is the home he left behind. For Uighurs in towns like these, the future is becoming increasingly uncertain because the decision, whether to stay or go, is often no longer in their hands.

Officers beating unarmed protesters with large sticks, [explosion] and firing tear gas in the streets and inside university buildings. We reviewed dozens of videos that have led to accusations that the police used excessive force against protesters. Protests at Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi are in response to a new citizenship law that will favor every major religion in South Asia except Islam. The Indian prime minister says the measure helps persecuted minority migrants. But students and teachers at the predominantly Muslim university are protesting the bill, which they say will exclusively target Muslims. Over the course of three days, the police and protesters clashed at the university. Some protesters were armed with sticks and rocks. But the protests were largely peaceful. But videos show how the police responded swiftly and indiscriminately. In one video shot in a nearby residential area, a group of women confront officers. But the officers are determined to stay. When a man tries to shield the women, he is grabbed from behind by officers and pulled to the ground. He appeared to be unarmed. But at least five officers beat him. In a video filmed inside the university by a reporter with The Indian Express, and widely circulated on Twitter, officers are seen beating protesters with large, heavy sticks. None of these protesters appear to be armed. One of the most harrowing examples of the police’s questionable tactics happened at the university’s library. A video from the library captures what appears to be a flash-bang grenade, a device often used to scare and disperse a crowd. Eyewitnesses say the police entered the campus and fired tear gas at protesters and students who were studying inside. Footage of the aftermath shows tear gas still lingering in the air. United Nations guidelines state that tear gas should never be used in confined spaces. Dozens of students were hospitalized after the protest. But the police say they used maximum restraint in their response. The protests against the controversial citizenship law have spread throughout India, galvanizing opposition groups, and setting up the prospect of more protests and more violence.

A neighborhood in the Syrian city of Maaret al Numan has just been hit by an airstrike. Rescuers are rushing to the scene when warnings of another attack come over the radio. As the camera tilts upward, it captures a small speck in the sky. This is a Russian plane, and it’s about to strike the city again. For years, Russia has been suspected of recklessly bombing civilians in Syria as they try to break the remaining pockets of resistance to President Assad. They’ve strongly denied it, and proving their role has been all but impossible. But now we have evidence. [Sirens blaring] Earlier Times investigations established that the Russian air force repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria, and this latest investigation traces how Russian pilots also launched some of the deadliest attacks on civilians in 2019. [Shouting and sirens] At the core of our investigations are intercepted cockpit recordings of Russian pilots and air controllers. Combined with video and photo data and warplane sightings, these recordings provide a critical missing link that show how, in two recent airstrikes, Russian pilots killed dozens of civilians. First, we’ll take a look at this settlement for displaced people in Syria’s last rebel-held area. It’s called Qaryat al Rahma, or “Village of Mercy.” This isolated complex was located near the city of Hass, around 8 miles from the nearest front line, and was home to over 100 families uprooted by years of war. One resident told us that families use the evening time to sit outside and cool off. Near sunset on Aug. 16, he heard planes flying overhead. It was a devastating strike. And here’s how the evidence shows that Russia was responsible. This photo, taken by a local journalist immediately after impact, is a crucial piece of the puzzle. We know it was taken in Hass because the features match earlier drone footage of the town. The buildings and pylons are all the same. And shrouded in smoke is the settlement for displaced people. We know because these windows and the mast on the roof also match the drone footage of the camp. Using the picture’s file data, we verified it was taken at 7:17 p.m. on Aug. 16, pinpointing the exact time of the attack. What was happening in the skies around this time? Five minutes before the strike, observers spotted and logged a Russian warplane over a nearby town. And at precisely 7:17, we hear a Russian pilot, with a call sign 464, launch an attack. The weapon landed in the middle of a courtyard where families had gathered. The blast leveled buildings, and the scene is carnage. [Shouting] The dead include a pregnant woman, her husband and their 2-year-old child. In all, 19 residents of the camp are killed, and 13 more are wounded. Another deadly attack this summer occurred just 4 miles away in Maarat al Numan — a densely populated city in the heart of opposition-controlled territory. On Monday morning, July 22, the city was hit repeatedly by airstrikes. The attack sparked so much outrage that Russia was forced to respond. They denied involvement. But the combined evidence of witness videos, flight logs and cockpit recordings contradict this and show how Russian Pilot 17 killed over 20 people in just half an hour. We’ve retraced what happened minute by minute. It’s 8:31 a.m. Pilot 17 receives a target, and four minutes later he launches a weapon, calling it “candy,” and prepares a second attack. The strike levels an entire building in a busy commercial area in the city. Local journalist Mohamed Sharawi films his rush to the scene. As the dust clears, he joins first responders who try to reach victims through the rear of an adjacent building. Above them, the Russian pilot is preparing to launch again, in two minutes, at 44 minutes past the hour. Mohammad and the others take cover, as flight spotters warn of another attack. He looks up and films a Russian fighter jet overhead. The pilot launches his weapon. Then the explosion. [Explosion] It’s what’s known as a double tap. It hits almost exactly the same location and kills a rescue worker. At 8:54, Pilot 17 confirms his third strike in the city, hitting a building around 800 yards away. [Explosion] Minutes later, he calculates his fourth and final round — and strikes another building on the outskirts of the town. [Explosion] The number killed is estimated at between 23 and 42 people, including two children — making it one of the worst attacks on a civilian area this year. The Russians are by no means alone in this. Combined with Syrian attacks, the U.N. says, over 1,000 civilians in northwest Syria have been killed or injured since April — hundreds of them children. So why is Russia attacking civilians? Experts tell us it’s the same reason they’re bombing hospitals. It’s all part of a strategy to break the will of the people, force them to flee, and to help the Syrian government retake the last opposition stronghold. And after more than eight years of war and very little in the way of consequences, Russia shows no signs of slowing down.	‘Sent Candy’: Cockpit Tapes Show Russian Pilots Bombing Syrian Civilians		['Evan Hill', 'Christiaan Triebert', 'Dmitriy Khavin', 'Malachy Browne', 'David Botti']	['cockpit', 'candy', 'syrian', 'pilots', 'strike', 'tapes', 'explosion', 'minutes', 'russian', 'bombing', 'civilians', 'city', 'killed', 'russia', 'sent', 'pilot', 'attack']	"[Shouting and sirens] At the core of our investigations are intercepted cockpit recordings of Russian pilots and air controllers.

It’s the second time the Russian Air Force bombed it this year. In May, Russian jets dropped four precision bombs on the very same facility, a previous Times investigation found. Kafr Nabl Surgical is a well-known hospital and in fact, the United Nations is investigating an earlier attack on it. Intentionally bombing health facilities is a war crime. But that doesn’t seem to have deterred Russia. We know its air force is responsible because we obtained radio messages recorded between Russian pilots and their ground control in Syria. We deciphered their code words, including the phrase to confirm an attack was launched, “Srabotal,” meaning “worked it.” We compared these audio recordings on Nov. 6 to video evidence of the attack, the same way we investigated the May attack. The evidence is clear. A security camera system inside the hospital filmed three strikes: at 4:19, 4:25 and 4:31 p.m. The radio system recorded Russian pilot 31 launching an attack at 4:21, 4:27 and 4:33 p.m. Why is there a slight discrepancy in these times? We confirmed the hospital cameras are three minutes behind, and look at the intervals between each strike: They match up almost to the second, one pilot confirming three attacks at the exact interval of strikes on the hospital. We also examined flight observations for Nov. 6 logged by a network of spotters in Syria, who track planes and listen into radio recordings. They witnessed only Russian jets circling Kafr Nabl at the time of the attacks at 4:23 and 4:29 p.m. Russia had to know this location was a hospital. Remember, a previous Times investigation showed that Russia had attacked it on May 5. The Defense Ministry spokesman acknowledged and responded to that story. The Russian ambassador to the United Nations was shown a copy of that investigation at a U.N. Security Council meeting. And the hospital’s location is on a no-strike list provided to Russia by the U.N. But this latest attack shows that Russia can continue to bomb health facilities in Syria with impunity.

But these coordinates aren’t for a military target. They point to this underground hospital. Moments later, the pilot bombs it. Nabad al Hayat is one of more than 50 health care facilities bombed in Syria since April, as president Bashar al-Assad seeks to retake the last pocket of opposition with a ferocious onslaught of air power. Observers have long suspected that Russia bombs hospitals. But no one has been able to prove it — until now. The Times has assembled a large body of evidence from multiple sources that directly implicates Russia in four hospital attacks in just 12 hours: one day that’s a microcosm of how health care has been crippled in parts of Syria. We collected four main types of evidence: First, flight logs. For years, a network of plane spotters has tracked air force activity over Syria to warn civilians of incoming attacks. They record sightings of fighter jets and listen in on open radio communications between pilots and air traffic controllers. We received months of those flight logs, which tell us where and when the Russian air force was flying. Second, we obtained thousands of recordings of those radio transmissions as Russian pilots operate in the skies above northwest Syria. We spent weeks translating and deciphering their code words to understand how they carry out airstrikes: A pilot receives coordinates for a target. He confirms the target is locked. The pilot calculates the minute he will strike. The dispatcher gives the green light. And the pilot reports back, saying, “Srabotal” — “I worked it.” This gives us the clearest picture yet of how and when Russia bombed targets. Third, we analyzed hours of videos of these strikes, which gave us clues about the type of weapons used. We reviewed that footage with experts on the Russian air force. And fourth, we established the time these attacks happened by interviewing medics, obtaining incident reports and examining social media postings. The times of the attacks matched up with sightings of Russian planes and recordings of pilots carrying out strikes. Our detailed findings show how Russia repeatedly violated one of the oldest laws of war. We’ll walk through those attacks on May 5 to show how the evidence stacks up. Let’s start with Nabad al Hayat, where local journalists were warned it could be bombed and filmed the attack. First, the strike time. An incident report said it was hit around 2:40 p.m. Second, flight logs: Spotters in the area reported a Russian jet flying overhead just minutes before the attack. Third, radio recordings: The Russian pilot and air traffic controller are heard preparing the attack minutes before 2:40 p.m. Those coordinates point directly at the underground hospital, and at 2:40, the pilot confirms the strike. Fourth, analysis of the strike itself: Three projectiles fall in quick succession and very precisely, within around 100 feet of each other. They also appear to explode after a slight delay once they penetrate the ground. Military experts told us these are the hallmarks of a precision strike, something the Syrian air force is not currently capable of, only the Russians. Luckily, the hospital was empty, because days before, staff had received warnings from plane spotters of possible attacks. It had in the past treated hundreds of patients every month, but it remains out of service today. Around three miles away, Doctors in Kafr Nabl were treating patients that afternoon when this single hospital was hit four times in 18 minutes. We spoke to one of its doctors. Again, the evidence from 5:30 p.m. points to Russia. Spotters reported both Russian and Syrian jets flying overhead. Next, radio messages record a Russian pilot making four strikes at that very time. At 5:30 p.m., the pilot says: At 5:35 p.m.: 5:40 p.m.: And 5:48 p.m.: Four strikes in all, each around five minutes apart, at the exact time witnesses reported the attack. And last, the weapon: Three precision strikes hit the hospital’s entrance. Experts told us it’s highly unlikely Syrian jets could do this. Because the hospital was dug deep underground, only one person was killed in the attack — though many were injured. The bombing didn’t stop there. Kafr Zita Cave Hospital was hit at 3:15 p.m. The hospital director reported it in a WhatsApp message to a colleague that day. Again, flight logs record a Russian jet near Kafr Zita around that time, and at 3:15, a Russian pilot confirms a strike. That night, Al Amal Orthopedic Hospital was hit. Again, only Russian jets were recorded flying in the area, and a Russian pilot confirms the strike around 2 a.m. Health care facilities have been attacked more than 600 times in the course of Syria’s war. It’s a deliberate strategy to make civilian life unbearable in opposition strongholds. In response to The Times, Russian officials denied responsibility and said they carry out precision strikes only on what they call “accurately researched targets.” But these hospitals were on a no-strike list that Russia received from the United Nations. And The Times confirmed with medical groups that they were operational on the day of the attacks. Russia and Syria should have known they were off limits. By law, it’s their responsibility to avoid hitting them. But this evidence paints a damning portrait of a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council committing gross violations in just one day of Russia’s four-year air campaign in Syria. Hey, this is Malachy, and I lead the team who worked on this video. We spent thousands of hours putting this investigation together, and we knew we had important new details to share when we got audio recordings of a Russian pilot receiving the coordinates for a hospital and then bombing it. The source of the audio asked to remain anonymous for their safety. But the evidence they provided was irrefutable. We do this work to find the truth and hold people in power to account.

We Break Down What Happened.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006745719/hong-kong-protester-shot.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	This is the moment a Hong Kong police officer shot an antigovernment protester. [gunshot] It marks a major escalation: The first time an officer fired a live round at a demonstrator since protests began almost four months ago. The scene was chaotic and captured on camera from various angles. We analyzed the footage to paint a comprehensive picture of what exactly happened. Let’s take a closer look: It’s China’s National Day. Hong Kong is engulfed in protests. In the Tsuen Wan neighborhood, a group of 15 protesters approach officers in riot gear. They start chasing and attacking one of the officers with umbrellas and what appear to be metal rods. The officer falls to the ground and protesters continue to beat him. We see one man swinging a hammer, and another person is holding a wrench. Police deploy tear gas. From this angle, we see an officer running up to the chaos with his revolver already drawn. A shot rings out. [gunshot] Here is the scene from another angle. We see the protester who’s about to get shot. He’s carrying a blue shield. The officer shoots him just as he’s swinging a metal rod at him. He stumbles and falls over the officer on the ground. The group scatters. One protester attempts to help the victim. He is tackled to the ground by another officer. A person dressed in black, who appears to be a protester, throws a Molotov cocktail at the officers from afar and then flees. We see at least two officers have their guns drawn. Another one holds a pepper-spray can threatening those nearby. Only now does the officer who shot the protester put his gun away. Note that he also carries nonlethal weapons. He’s holding a shotgun, which is likely loaded with rubber bullets, and has pepper spray in his holster. The protester who was shot remains on the ground, seemingly conscious. We don’t see any of the officers provide first aid at this point. According to U.N. basic principles, officers should only use firearms under imminent threat of death or serious injury, and they need to give a clear warning of their intent to use a gun. The officer in the video does not appear to warn the protesters that he is going to shoot. Police said that one protester had tried to stab the officer on the ground with a sharp object and that police had warned protesters to stop. They defended their officer’s decision to use live fire. Police said that the 18-year-old protester was shot near his left shoulder and was taken to the hospital. The incident marks a clear escalation in police response to the protests and is sure to fuel more unrest among the people of Hong Kong.	Hong Kong Police Shot a Protester at Point-Blank Range.

Here’s What They Look Like.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000006681200/border-immigration-tent-courthouses.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	More than a dozen new tents have popped up at two locations along the U.S. border with Mexico. These are temporary courtrooms for migrants who are claiming asylum. They offer a glimpse into how the Trump administration’s unprecedented crackdown on immigration is playing out with judges deciding the fate of hundreds of asylum seekers via video, and in makeshift facilities. We pinpointed their locations and satellite imagery and tracked their expansion over a month. We can see them here, along the border in Laredo, Tex. There are several long tents, subdivided into courts, where 420 asylum hearings are planned each day. And in Brownsville, Tex., another set of tent courthouses. This one, for more than 700 cases a day. Judges will handle cases via video. A top immigration official spoke recently, praising the technology. “Spectacular video-conferencing facility, the mechanics of that will be used for hearings.” But some advocates have said that this will worsen already limited due process for asylum seekers. And a 2017 Justice Department study also raised additional concerns about video and the difficulty for judges to analyze eye contact, nonverbal forms of communication and body language. These courtroom tents are part of the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, which is formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. It was implemented in January and aimed at limiting the number of asylum seekers arriving in the U.S. “They will have to wait for approval to come into the United States: If they are granted asylum by a U.S. judge, they will be welcomed into America, if they are not, they will be removed to their home countries.” Typically, people seeking asylum were allowed to remain in the United States while their cases went through courts around the country, due to the danger they would face at home. Putting these tent courts along the border allows the U.S. to send asylum seekers to Mexico until it’s time for their hearings. But this could also put people in harm’s way. The location of these tent courts means some asylum seekers will be forced to await their trials in some of the most dangerous cities along the border in Mexico. Brownsville and Laredo border the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where the U.S. State Department has issued a travel advisory to the same degree as for Syria and Afghanistan. American citizens are told not to travel here due to crime and kidnapping, and human rights groups have documented cases of rape, abduction and murder of migrants. Meanwhile, U.S. immigration authorities are considering additional locations for tent courts. But by forcing asylum seekers to wait in high-risk areas, some migrants may never be able to return for their day in court.	Trump Is Having Tent Courthouses Built Along the Border.

Protests here began nine weeks ago in response to a controversial extradition bill. But demonstrators are now demanding more widespread democratic reforms. Protesters have faced a heavy police crackdown. And while some have gotten violent by throwing bricks and using slingshots, many more have employed innovative tactics to stay safe. They’ve tried to extinguish tear gas canisters with water bottles, using traffic cones and metal bowls to snuff out the gas before it spreads. On the front lines, many demonstrators wear makeshift armor. Saran wrap becomes skin protection, while garbage can lids and luggage are made into shields. The near-weekly protests have also stood out for their meticulous organization. Videos show protesters forming human supply chains, some over one mile long. And to communicate what supplies are needed, they use hand signals passed along the chain. In this video, protesters are asking for helmets. Several videos show how the massive crowds part to allow ambulances free passage. For the most part, the protests are organized anonymously. Posters with information about marches are shared through AirDrop and Telegram chats. Protesters have adopted a strategy they’re calling “Be Water” in order to evade the police. It means that they move quickly rather than occupying a single location. You can see that in this video: a large group of protesters entering a train station so they can travel to another area. And here, riot police have just arrived to disperse a crowd that has already left. Anti-government demonstrators, most wearing masks, have also established new ways to hide their identities. Laser pointers and spray paint are used to obscure security cameras. And some people leave single-use transit tickets at train stations so that protesters don’t have to use the card registered to their name. It doesn’t seem like the protests will end anytime soon. Though hundreds have been arrested in recent weeks, thousands more have been able to evade police capture. It’s clear that as the demonstrations continue, this level of organization will remain key to keeping the movement alive.

A group of men in white shirts attacked demonstrators heading home after an antigovernment march. Protesters said that officers ignored their repeated calls for help. Under public pressure, the police defended their actions and acknowledged small gaps in their response. But their conduct left many wondering why they didn’t do more. We reviewed hours of video and spoke to a dozen witnesses to look at how officers failed to stop the violence. Our investigation reconstructs what happened that night. It’s Sunday, July 21. Antigovernment demonstrations are happening on Hong Kong Island. Protests like this one have been going on for weeks. They started in opposition to a controversial extradition bill. But now, protester demands are growing. Meanwhile, 18 miles away in Yuen Long — a town near the border with mainland China — a crowd has gathered. Most are wearing white T-shirts and rallying in support of the government. A prominent, pro-Beijing lawmaker is there. Traditional villages in this region have a long history with Hong Kong’s organized crime societies known as triads. Experts say that while the triads have a patriotic reputation, they’re essentially thugs for hire and will work for whomever pays them the most. Members of triads have been accused of violence against antigovernment protesters in the past and some of the people behind the night’s violence were later identified by police as triad members. Now, let’s go back to what happened that night. It’s just past 10 p.m. where the pro-government rally is taking place and things are getting violent. Videos show at least three individuals being beaten by men in white T-shirts. Lam Cheuk-ting, a lawmaker who supported some antigovernment protests, says he learns about the violence and calls the police at 10:22 p.m. Outside, at around 10:40 p.m., we see men in white walking towards the Yuen Long train station, where antigovernment protesters from Hong Kong Island have been arriving on their way home. Lam Cheuk-ting warns them of the danger outside. But the mob comes inside the station. And they begin to taunt the protesters. Moments later, we see two officers leaving the scene. Police said that they had received the first call from the train station at 10:41 p.m., and that these officers left to call for backup. But once they leave, the violence escalates. [screaming] A reporter is livestreaming when she’s attacked by the mob People run up the stairs trying to escape. The men in white chase them onto a train. Some men hold open the train doors while others beat people inside. Bystanders are caught up in the melee. Meanwhile, others are trying to get help at two nearby police stations. But when some arrive at Yuen Long police station, officers are seen closing the gates. And at another police station, officers sit inside as people bang on the door. Police later said that officers closed the doors for security reasons. Back at the train station, the violence continues. Finally, the train leaves. Lam Cheuk-ting is among the injured. The violence lasts for about 20 minutes. In our analysis, we never see any police officers at the scene during this period. It’s now 11:15 p.m. As some of the men in white T-shirts run away, police do not appear to pursue any of the perpetrators. Protesters confront police for their lack of action for nearly half an hour. At this point, the officers leave the station, entrance gates close behind them. But at 12:26 a.m., the mob in white T-shirts is back. They break through the train station gate and start to beat people again. Eight minutes later this dash cam video shows men in white T-shirts casually walking past police vehicles while officers walk away. White-shirted men continue to beat protesters outside. Some of the men gather at a parking lot. In this video, we see police entering the train station as the men in white are just outside. Police surround the area for the next couple hours. It’s 2:35 a.m., we see two men still holding their weapons, chatting with officers. This is important because hours later, police officials said that they did not see anyone holding weapons. Finally, around 4 a.m. several of the men in white T-shirts drive away. No one was arrested overnight. At least 45 people were injured during the attack at the Yuen Long station. Police have admitted that they were informed about a potential attack in Yuen Long in advance. The Hong Kong police commissioner said the antigovernment protests were the reason for the slow police response. The police have since arrested 12 suspects for the attacks, many of them with triad connections. Still, protesters say officers could have done more to prevent the violence. Almost a week after this incident, thousands gathered in Yuen Long to protest the attack and the police response. This time, the men in white shirts appeared to remain on the sidelines. And it was the police who countered protesters with force.	‘Please Stop Beating Us’: Where Were Hong Kong’s Police?		['Barbara Marcolini', 'Haley Willis', 'K.K.

trusted	How Kim Jong-un Smuggled Luxury Mercedes to North Korea	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006469635/north-korea-sanctions.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	Kim Jong-un is becoming a more prominent figure on the world stage. He now frequently leaves North Korea and welcomes top officials in Pyongyang. And when looking at the dictator’s high-profile public appearances, it would be difficult not to notice that they all share something in common: Mercedes. Mercedes. Rolls-Royce and more Mercedes. But how did Kim manage to get these luxury, bulletproof vehicles — in open violation of an international ban on luxury goods — to North North Korea? To answer this question, we teamed up with the non-profit research group Center for Advanced Defense Studies, which published a detailed report on sanctions evasions. Using shipping and corporate data, satellite images and interviews, we investigated a shipment of two bulletproof Mercedes. These vehicles cost at least $500,000 and are primarily marketed to world leaders. We followed them through a circuitous network of ports, apparently designed to cloak their movement, and onto a ghost ship owned by a Russian businessman whose company has been accused of evading sanctions. Our story offers a glimpse into how North Korea skirts sanctions and how it likely uses similar techniques to procure far more dangerous goods. So first, let’s take a look at the actual route. And the trail starts: in a shipping terminal in Rotterdam in June 2018. The first part of the journey looks like a regular shipment. Nothing out of the ordinary. The cars are on two of the containers on this ship. From here, they’re transported on a major international shipping line. After a 41 day journey, the cars arrive in China. We track them to the port of Dalian. From here, the cars are shipped to Japan, and from there they are sent in yet another ship to another port in Busan, South Korea. And here, the Russian-owned ship at the center of our investigation enters the picture. It picks up the containers and when it leaves the port, mysteriously vanishes, turning off its required transponder. Eighteen days later, the ship reappears, but now the cars are gone. And instead, it’s carrying coal. So, what just happened? Let’s take a closer look at this ghost ship. Its convoluted background offers clues as to why it was not at all a regular transport. It used to be called Xiang Jin and had links to North Korea. But shortly before it gets the cars, its name changes to DN5505 and its ownership is transferred to Do Young Shipping, a shell company in the Marshall Islands. It’s Do Young Shipping that’s owned by the Russian national. But you’d never know it because it sails under the flag of the West African nation Togo. And its safety manager is based in Hong Kong. Confused? That’s the idea. Using that many jurisdictions is a classic sanctions evasion strategy. Our reporting also shows that this ship was trailing the cargo as soon as it entered China. Do you see it? It’s right here. Satellite images we found suggest that it tried to pick up the cars at other ports in Asia. But the handoff happens weeks later in South Korea. So where did the containers go? Vladivostok, Russia. And here is why we think that: First, the ship’s last reported destination before the transponder was turned off was a coal port next to Vladivostok. We think the cars were offloaded in this area. Second, the owner of the Russian ghost ship is based in Vladivostok. His name is Danil Kazachuk. And he confirmed that he bought and sold the Mercedes in a phone call to a Times reporter, but offered no further details. Four months after the cars disappeared, South Korean officials seized two of Kazachuk’s ships, including the ghost ship, for alleged illicit trade of coal and oil with North Korea. Third, we tracked these North Korean transport planes, which made a rare visit to Vladivostok on Oct. 7 — perfectly timed with the arrival of the containers. They are the very planes that normally carry Kim’s luxury vehicles and a possible direct transportation link to North Korea. Our final clue: In January 2019, the same exact model of armored Mercedes was spotted on the streets of Pyongyang by the website North Korea News. [cheering] The route to Asia. The ghost ship in Busan. The North Korean planes. It’s not possible to say if every part of this journey was illicit. But since 2016, sanctions experts say that North Korea has used similar techniques to bring in vital fuel sources and technology for its weapons program. Which raises the question: How effective are sanctions as a tool to pressure Kim Jong-un to end his nuclear ambitions?

What the Videos Show	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006602584/hong-kong-police-protest-video-investigation.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	Tear-gassed, beaten and dragged. Protesters in Hong Kong have accused the police of using excessive force during a political demonstration in June. Hong Kong officials have pushed back. “My officers are acting in accordance with our guidelines.” The New York Times analyzed hundreds of videos, spoke to protesters who were beaten and interviewed experts in crowd control. We identified seven incidents caught on camera that contradict official statements and show that police officers did use excessive force, according to experts. On June 9, one million people took to the streets to protest a bill that would allow Hong Kong to detain and extradite people to mainland China. The proposal stoked fears over the erosion of civil liberties that have long set Hong Kong apart from the Chinese mainland. Protesters’ demands went unheeded. And days later, on June 12, lawmakers put the bill to a vote. Thousands gathered at the government headquarters in protest. The demonstration was mostly peaceful, but a small group of protesters threw objects at officers in an attempt to breach police lines. Officers responded, beating protesters with batons and using tear gas and riot control ammunition indiscriminately. Peaceful demonstrators found themselves in the middle of the chaos. Ying-mo, a retired mechanic’s instructor, was watching the protest. In this video, we see him unarmed walking toward police. An officer aims a gun, likely loaded with balls containing pepper spray. A popping sound is heard. Ying-mo falls to the ground. Three officers pick him up and carry him away. Ying-mo was charged with participating in an unlawful assembly and released on bail. What happened to him was not an isolated incident. In this video, another protester stands near officers. Riot police pull him to the ground and beat him. He is taken to the sidewalk and arrested. In another incident, a man who is distributing water is attacked by the police. Officers pepper spray him, punch him and beat him with batons. One officer puts him in a chokehold. In some cases, commanders participate in the violence. They are identified by white shirts. When this protester falls to the ground, two commanders are among a group of police who attack her with batons and shields. And this woman said she was dragged for about 150 meters to the legislative council by a commander. All of the protesters shown here were arrested and later released, some on bail. Dr. Rohini Haar, an expert in crowd control, said these police actions were unjustified. Some of the most chaotic scenes happened when police fired tear gas at protesters trapped outside an office building. Early on that day protesters set up barricades on the street. Around 3 p.m., officers surrounded the building on both sides, firing tear gas. Trapped by the police and barricades, protesters rushed toward the tower’s main entrance. Those who make it inside attempt to open locked doors to allow more people through. But the police continue to fire tear gas into the crowd. Ivy Chan was volunteering at the protest, assisting people outside the tower. Dr. Haar said the police caused unnecessary panic. As violence escalated, Wu Chi-wai, a prominent Hong Kong lawmaker, walked the front lines. As he moves toward the police, a commander directs another officer to fire tear gas. He continues marching, and a second canister is fired. Anna Feigenbaum, an expert in the use of tear gas, said that it should never be used like a firearm. We sent these videos to the Hong Kong police, but they did not respond to our request for comment. At least 81 people were injured in the demonstration, according to the Hong Kong government. Police have said 22 officers were injured. Officials have promised an investigation into police actions, and the extradition bill was suspended after June 12. But protesters want more. They are asking for an independent inquiry and the full withdrawal of the bill.	Did Hong Kong Police Use Violence Against Protesters?

It was sheltering hundreds of African migrants and refugees when it was hit by an airstrike on July 2. The attack killed at least 53 people and wounded many more. How could something like this happen to a migrant holding center? The Times analyzed photos, videos, and satellite images of the facility. And former detainees and humanitarian observers in Libya told us grim stories of lapses on many fronts. Anti-government forces vying for control in Libya carried out this airstrike. But the attack has shed new light on a simple fact: Thousands of migrants are now trapped in the crosshairs of a brutal civil war between the Libyan government and those rebels. And it exposes serious failures on the part of the European Union, which has outsourced some of its migration problems to a country in chaos. The E.U. declined our interview requests and pointed to statements calling for an investigation, and for migrants to be moved. Libya has become a crossroads for Africans fleeing turmoil at home and trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. But the European Union has looked to Libya to prevent them from making the journey. It has given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Libyan Coast Guard and agencies supporting detention centers like the one in Tajoura. Overcrowding and lack of medical care in the centers has caused widespread health problems, experts say. “All these detention centers in Libya — they were built as warehouses. It’s just, they’ve now been repurposed for — instead of storing goods, they’re storing people.” And those who complained were often threatened by guards and militias that control those centers. The dire conditions inside the facilities are made even worse by what’s going on outside. The most serious issue we’ve uncovered is that the Tajoura center is located in a military compound. And the migrants’ living quarters are less than 100 yards from what our reporting shows is a weapons depot. We can confirm that these trucks with heavy weapons were photographed inside it. Migrants have told us they were forced to work in this depot cleaning and maintaining weapons for a pro-government militia that effectively controls the compound. Others say, the militia forced them to take up arms. This weapons depot is key, because on July 2 it was clearly targeted by the rebels. Images of the aftermath showed damaged military vehicles and the remains of an anti-aircraft gun. The nearby detention center was struck moments later. This security camera filmed what happened. First, the weapons depot was hit by an airstrike. Shrapnel is sent flying across the parking lot towards the migrant center. As smoke and debris spills out, people try to flee. But the guards stop them, witnesses told us. Then, 11 minutes later, a second airstrike hits the migrant detention center directly. Hundreds of people are confined inside. Some escape while others try to break through a locked door to the victims on the other side. These migrants were sitting ducks for rebel airstrikes and European officials should have known this. Why? Because some had visited the site. And the area had been targeted before. On May 7, an airstrike hit the very same weapons depot sending shrapnel through the roof of the migrant center. Two people were injured. And even before this, migrants in Libya tried to alert the public to the danger they were in. We obtained voice recordings from people being held in Tajoura and other centers. The U.N. refugee agency says it has tried to move migrants away from Tripoli. Italy is the only European country that took some migrants in. The ultimate blame for the attack on Tajoura lies with Khalifa Hifter, a Libyan strongman fighting to topple the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. The U.N. says it shared. the center’s coordinates with his forces. But it didn’t matter. And the Tajoura strike may be far from the last. The U.N. says there are 3,800 refugees and migrants in Libya still being detained in areas of active clashes. Meanwhile, the survivors in Tajoura were released by the Libyan government on July 9. Some may be taken in by the U.N. But hundreds of others walked out onto the streets of an active conflict zone, uncertain of what lay ahead.

trusted	The U.S. Says Iran Attacked Tankers. Does the Evidence Add Up?	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006558872/iran-tanker-video.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	When explosions crippled two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on June 13, the incident immediately heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran and raised alarms about the security of a vital passageway for a third of the world’s petroleum. The U.S. blamed Iran for unprovoked attacks on the ship. “— present a clear threat.” Iran said American officials were “warmongering.” The main evidence the U.S. has presented to the public to support its claim are these photos and this surveillance footage taken several hours after the attack on one of the tankers. The footage has significant gaps, cuts out at key moments and zooms in and out. It does not depict a single sequence of events or an explosive being planted. Days later, the U.S. released new images to back up its claim. They don’t show definitively who is responsible for the attacks. But here’s what the images do show us. First, the tanker: We can confirm that this tanker, the Kokuka Courageous, is the same ship that was approached by the Iranian vessel. These distinctive features match. And shipping data confirms it was 20 miles off the coast of Iran when it was attacked. Next, the patrol boat, which does appear to be Iranian. It matches the model and dimensions of patrol boats used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy. The chevron pattern on the bow of the boat matches, and so does the center console. And they both have antiaircraft guns. An Iranian source familiar with the country’s military operations told us that this clearer picture of the same patrol boat does show an I.R.G.C. vessel. And the incident occurred in Iran’s area of responsibility. Last, the alleged mine: A U.S. Navy ship took this photograph before the Iranian patrol appeared. It shows damage to the ship and what appears to be an object protruding from the hull. The new images released by the U.S. Defense Department appear to show the outline of a limpet mine similar to this mine design on the right. The dimensions of the mine match. These markings match clasps used to attach the mine to the tanker and this remnant matches the size and design of those clasps. Weapons experts say this could resemble limpet mines that are available to Iran, but there’s still no conclusive proof that they are Iranian. So it appears that an Iranian boat did remove a limpet mine from the ship’s hull. But importantly, the pictures released by the U.S. lack the crucial piece of evidence: The moment the mine was placed. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that President Trump wants to avoid war. “President Trump does not want war. We will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.” Even still, the Defense Department decided to send 1,000 additional troops to the region in response. But as U.S.-Iran relations continue to crumble, this slim waterway will remain a hotbed of tension.	The U.S. Says Iran Attacked Tankers. Does the Evidence Add Up?

trusted	One Bomb. 11 Children Killed. And the Evidence That Implicates the U.S.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006466390/american-airstrike-afghanistan.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	This is Mohammad Ilyas. He lived in eastern Afghanistan. He was eight years old when an airstrike killed him inside his home last fall. His six brothers and sisters were killed, too. So was their mother, Amina, and four young cousins. Twelve dead in total, an entire immediate family gone, except for one person — the husband and father, 39-year-old Masih Mubarez. It’s a familiar story for civilians caught up in the 18-year war. Mubarez has searched in vain for answers about his family’s deaths. He went public with his plight. A U.N. statement pointed toward American responsibility, but the answers never came. Along with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, we investigated the airstrike. We wanted to find out who was behind the attack and how complicated it would be to get answers. Our own analysis of the airstrike’s aftermath led us to the U.S. military. The U.S. denied the strike, later admitted it. But even today, it still hasn’t acknowledged civilians were killed. Mubarez’s story shows just how hard it can be to find the truth when your family is killed in Afghanistan. Here’s how it unfolded. The airstrike on the family home happened here, in a remote area southwest of Kabul. Mubarez survived because he was 1,000 miles away in Iran, working illegally. It was the only way he could earn money. Mubarez’s wife Amina called him on the morning of the airstrike, seven hours before she would be killed. Already, something was wrong. Their home was in an area mostly controlled by the Taliban. The Afghan military, backed by the U.S., is fighting to get it back. One Afghan army raid there a few months earlier was captured on camera. Amina told her husband that a raid similar to this had just taken place in their village. She said foreign soldiers were there, too, speaking English. That phone call was the last time Mubarez and Amina ever spoke. The raid was part of an operation to free Afghan army soldiers from a Taliban prison. The prison was just 200 yards from Mubarez’s house. This is the home before it was destroyed. Here are the living quarters. The family was in there when the bomb struck the morning after the raid. Photos we obtained show fragments of the weapon that was used. The twisted metal holds several clues, including a square pattern of four bolts on a tailfin. Weapons experts said this construction is only used in one type of aerial weapon — a JDAM. JDAMs are devices with fins that fit onto the backs of bombs to steer them and make them more accurate. We then traced an ID number on another piece of debris to a U.S.-based company that manufactures parts for guided weapons. So we knew the weapon, but we still needed to figure out who launched it. There are just two forces conducting airstrikes in Afghanistan — the Afghan government and the United States. But only U.S. warplanes are capable of carrying JDAMs. Two weeks after the airstrike, the U.S. military said it could find no connection between an American operation and the deaths of Mubarez’s family. Five months after the airstrike, the U.S. denied that any strike ever took place in the area of Mubarez’s home. But that’s not the story Mubarez tells. When we recently gave the U.S. military the precise coordinates of the Mubarez home, their story changed. They now admit to striking it. They say it was done in self-defense because of sniper fire coming from the house. Taliban fighters often use civilians as shields against American airstrikes. But the U.S. military denies that any civilians were killed in the airstrike. We spoke to a medical analyst who concluded that the family’s corpses show injuries consistent with the effects of an explosive blast. That leaves Mubarez still with lots of questions, but with no one to take responsibility for killing his family.	One Bomb. 11 Children Killed.

trusted	The U.S. Blamed Maduro for Burning Aid to Venezuela. New Video Casts Doubt.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/americas/100000006385986/the-us-blamed-maduro-for-burning-aid-to-venezuela-new-video-casts-doubt.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	An American aid convoy, engulfed in flames, at a border crossing between Colombia and Venezuela: The scene has become a critical flashpoint in the political and economic crisis gripping the country. Senior U.S. officials immediately seized on the incident, blaming President Maduro and his supporters for intentionally torching the convoy. But an investigation by The Times calls this conclusion into serious question and shows that U.S. officials raced to judgment without the full facts. How did we get here? The Venezuelan crisis came to a head in early 2019, when opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself president in a bid to unseat Nicolás Maduro, whose authoritarian rule and economic mismanagement resulted in searing poverty. Backed by the U.S., Guaidó mobilized his followers to bring American aid into Venezuela. But Maduro blocked border crossings and denied entry. On Feb. 23, four aid trucks arrived at a bridge on the Colombian side of the border. Guaidó supporters cleared a path and drove the trucks toward Venezuela. Security forces repelled them, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, and the aid trucks got stuck on the bridge. The Colombian government released this annotated footage of the standoff. They circle the Venezuelan police near the trucks before the fire breaks out. The implication appears to be that the Maduro regime caused the fire. But note the time stamp in the footage they circulated: It suddenly jumps ahead by 13 minutes and misses the critical moments leading up to the fire. We obtained previously unseen TV footage that fills this gap and tells a more complicated story. So let’s back up the TV footage and see what happened. A small group of protesters starts throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. We’ll focus on this one protester. Here we see him throwing two Molotovs toward police. Let’s look at the scene again. Four trucks are stranded on the bridge. The protester approaches from here, behind the third truck. He launches one Molotov. But the second one separates and the burning rag veers off toward the trucks — not the police. Let’s fast forward a little, and we’ll synchronize the security footage. We can see that a fire has taken hold on one of the trucks. This is just 30 seconds after the burning rag landed in this area. This sequence of events shows the fire was most likely started by an errant Molotov, not by Maduro security forces. In minutes, the cargo is ablaze. As this journalist turns the corner to get a better angle, she takes the same route as the protester who threw the Molotov and points her camera in the direction the rag went, where a fire is now blazing. This was the start of the fire that spread rapidly and consumed three trucks. Both police and protesters scrambled to contain the scene. As the chaos was unfolding, the incident quickly escalated into a political firestorm. A Venezuelan journalist tweeted this report, blaming Maduro. Twelve minutes later, Senator Marco Rubio retweeted the unsubstantiated claim. National security adviser John Bolton weighed in soon after. And then U.S.A.I.D. administrator Mark Green claimed that Maduro had ordered the burning. Secretary of State Pompeo tweeted out the same visuals that evening. None of the U.S. officials offered any definitive evidence supporting their claim. They doubled down on Sunday talk shows: “There’s a sick tyrant, Maduro, who’s denying food to starving Venezuelans and medicine to sick Venezuelans; burning trucks with … this is the worst of the worst of a tyrant.” And officials continue to cite the burning trucks at the U.N. Security Council. “Armed gangs, thugs and criminals released from prisons were mobilized to control the border. Their actions led to the burning of humanitarian assistance rather than its protection.” It’s true that Maduro has a horrific human rights record and that he deploys armed gangs called colectivos to terrorize the opposition. But in this specific incident, our analysis shows U.S. officials used unverified claims to spin their side of the story. Officials we contacted either did not comment or failed to provide evidence supporting their claims. What happened on the bridge is a classic example of how misinformation spreads online. A rumor or unproven claim is made. It’s amplified by influential people. Mainstream media brings it to the masses. “Venezuelan national guardsmen under orders from President Nicolás Maduro attacked two aid trucks yesterday, lighting them on fire.” And in this case, there were real-life consequences. “Effective today, the United States will impose additional sanctions on regime officials.” And those new sanctions were triggered in part by the burning of aid trucks on the bridge.

trusted	An Israeli Soldier Killed a Medic in Gaza. We Investigated the Fatal Shot.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000005933727/israel-gaza-medic-killed-rouzan-najjar.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	[gunfire] “We are learning more about a young Palestinian nurse killed on Friday while —” “A young medic’s final moment: Rouzan al-Najjar races to help an injured Palestinian protester.” On June 1, 2018, an Israeli soldier shot into a crowd of protesters in Gaza, killing a volunteer medic named Rouzan al-Najjar. “There has been a huge reaction across Gaza to the death —” Her death sparked outrage and grabbed the world’s attention. “She is the latest victim of Israeli gunfire.” “The U.N. and human rights groups have accused Israel of using disproportionate force.” Israel says it uses live fire only as a last resort. “We have a very specific record of every shot.” “Israel only targeted people who were actively engaged in violence.” “And we only use live fire in a measured and surgical way.” But what about Rouzan? Israel’s army said it would investigate her death, but they offered us little explanation. “We don’t know exactly how and what happened. The adverse results are clear.” We’d met and interviewed Rouzan weeks before she was killed. We returned to Gaza to investigate her death and found that virtually every minute of the day she died was filmed by journalists, medics and protesters. We analyzed over 1,000 of their photos and videos, frame by frame. We mapped the protest area. And with the agency Forensic Architecture, we made a precise 3-D model of it. We studied ballistics evidence and autopsy records. And our reporters reviewed the visual evidence with more than 30 key witnesses. Our investigation reconstructs what happened that day. It reveals how Rouzan was killed, and shows how Israel used lethal force to control the protests, often in a way that has led to tragic consequences. Rouzan was already somewhat of a local celebrity by the time we met her in May. “Rouzan al-Najjar.” She was known for being the first woman to volunteer as a medic when protests began. By volunteering, Rouzan broke Gaza’s rigid gender norms. She wasn’t a doctor or a nurse. She told us she just wanted to help the wounded. Gazans had been coming to the boundary line with Israel since March. They wanted to protest the blockade imposed by Israel since Hamas seized power in Gaza 11 years ago. [chanting] Thousands came in peace — to highlight their grinding poverty and isolation. But Hamas — which calls for Israel’s destruction — saw a chance to ride the wave of anger. They backed the protests, and urged participants to break through the border fence. [chanting] Some protesters threw stones, or flew burning kites into Israel. Others cut openings in the fence, one that was built only to detect intrusion, not stop it. To Israel, breaching the fence amounted to an imminent threat to rural communities a few hundred yards from the Gaza side. “I can only, you know, use what they publish here. And you can see here, Nahal Oz. This is Gaza. Nahal Oz is 700 meters.” Taking no chances, Israel warned that its army would use lethal force against anyone who approached the fence, and it did. On the worst day of violence in May, it shot over 1,000 people. “I don’t know of any army that would do anything differently if you had to protect your border against people who say, ‘We’re going to destroy you.’” But its soldiers also shot even after violence had passed, and toward nonviolent protesters and bystanders who were far from the fence. [gunfire] And that’s what happened on the day Rouzan was killed. We’ll take you through her final hour. But first, we’ll map out the area around the fence, because the position of soldiers and protesters that day is key to understanding what follows. This is the fence that separates Israel and Gaza. On the Israeli side, snipers in jeeps are positioned here. Around 40 yards into the Gaza side are long coils of barbed wire. And for most of the afternoon, protesters and onlookers are here, about 100 yards back. And what keeps the protesters back there, and away from the fence, is tear gas. As protesters approach the fence throwing stones, the Israel Defense Forces, the I.D.F., repels them with gas. [shouting] It’s a scene that replays over and over, and it keeps Rouzan and the other medics busy. As a means to keep back protesters, tear gas is working. But in the 15 minutes before Rouzan is killed, the protesters move closer toward the fence. There are three separate incidents by the barbed wire, and the I.D.F. begins to fire live rounds. The first incident happens here, and it draws the medics in. Two protesters are injured on the ground, and Rouzan leads the medics to rescue them. She waves at soldiers not to shoot. Medics are protected by international law, but the I.D.F. fires a warning shot near them. The medics see a soldier emerge from behind a jeep, his rifle leveled at them. Rouzan is the last to pull back. This is the first time that medics are taken out by gas that afternoon. Back among the protest crowd, Rouzan catches her breath. But the violence around her intensifies. The second incident happens far upfield, about 200 yards from the main protest area. A group of protesters splits off and digs in at the barbed wire. The I.D.F. is caught off guard. They race up in jeeps. The protesters throw stones and firebombs. The I.D.F. responds again with a barrage of gas, pushing many of the protesters back. The I.D.F. told us firebombs escalated matters. After they’re thrown, snipers get ready atop this berm, near where the medics and soldiers were face to face moments earlier. We’ll come back to these berms, shortly. The third incident happens here, to the other side of the medics and protesters. Protesters attach a hook to the barbed wire and start pulling a segment away. Lamiaa, a medic who was standing with Rouzan, senses danger. Again, the I.D.F. launches gas. The rope pullers tug away a small coil of wire and run off. Much of the crowd follows along. By now, Rouzan and Lamiaa are walking back through the crowd, far from the fence. We spot them in this blurry Facebook Live video. For a moment, the violent protesting seems to be dissipating. [gunfire] It’s 6:31, the fatal shot. Three medics fall — Mohammed, Rami and Rouzan. Doctors in a nearby field clinic fail to resuscitate her. She’s rushed to a hospital, but it’s too late. At 7:10, Rouzan is pronounced dead. How did Rouzan die that day? We’ll freeze that fatal moment in time. Here’s the shot. In the distance are the three medics who are hit. Here’s Rami, holding his thigh. There’s Mohammed. And here, to the left, is Rouzan, partially obscured. She’s actually one of eight medics in this particular frame. We worked with the research agency Forensic Architecture to create a 3-D model of the protest field from multiple cameras. Here are the medics in white, and Rouzan in orange. Where did the shot come from? We drew a line through Rouzan and Rami, the two medics who were directly hit by the bullet. Allowing for a margin of error, we traced the bullet back to the same sand berms where the medics stood opposite Israeli soldiers minutes earlier. How did one bullet hit two medics and injure a third? The snipers are aiming almost parallel to the ground and firing a large battlefield bullet. Former snipers told us that a hefty round like this could easily skim like a stone off the rocky soil, endangering everyone in its path — and that appears to be what happened. Here’s another angle — [gunfire] the shot. [shouting] There’s Rami and Mohammed, with only his legs visible. Let’s rewind. [gunfire] Notice, two people point. They told us they saw where the bullet hit the ground, just a few feet from the medics. The bullet continued onward . Here’s Rami. The bullet grazed his thigh. There’s Mohammed. The bullet sprayed his torso with debris, including the copper jacket of the bullet. And that’s Rouzan. The bullet pierced her chest and severed her aorta. Two fragments came out through her medic’s vest. We asked Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus how the I.D.F. decides to shoot live rounds. “It would be a very precise identification of a target where the sniper asks for permission. The officer would grant that permission and then the sniper would execute that order.” “But that, that target has to have been — himself or herself — has to have been doing something violent that poses a threat?” “Yes. Whenever there was a situation where we would have rioters cutting the fence, throwing grenades and being able to breach inside, those were the situations where we took action against.” A senior I.D.F. commander told us that soldiers shot four protesters that day. All of them, he said, were acting violently. We found the first and third targets in the group that broke upfield. The first fell around 50 or 60 yards from the fence. We saw the third target throwing stones a few minutes before he was shot. The fourth target appears to have been alone when he was shot, around 150 yards from the fence. We don’t know what he was doing. What about the second shot — the one that killed Rouzan? Who was acting violently at that time? We analyzed videos taken from several angles before the fatal shot, frame by frame. We focus in on the space between the medics and the soldiers at the fence, and we don’t see a single protester or violent threat within 100 yards of the fence. Remember, the I.D.F. says it uses live fire only as a last resort. So why take that shot? We know it was fired at 6:31 p.m. Right before this video clip. The senior I.D.F. commander told us that at that time, they shot a protester in a yellow shirt who was pulling at the fence and throwing stones. We reviewed multiple videos and found a few men wearing yellow shirts, but only one near the bullet’s path. The man in yellow wasn’t acting violently in the minutes before the shot, and he couldn’t have been an imminent threat. He’s too far from the fence. He also wasn’t shot. And most importantly, behind him were the medics in white coats. “Really, the question is, even if you had a legitimate target with medics right behind, why would you take that shot?” “It’s very difficult to say. Very difficult to say. I mean, I think it’s —” “I mean, isn’t it reckless?” “No, I wouldn’t say so.” But the soldier fired through a group of medics. We talked to a ballistics expert, and former I.D.F. and U.S. army snipers. They told us it’s a shot you don’t take. In public, Israel says it uses lethal force as a last resort against imminent threats to Israeli life. But at the border fence, we found it took a more permissive approach. It treated the crowd of protesters itself as an imminent threat and allowed soldiers to shoot pre-emptively at targets within it to prevent a breach. That often meant putting nonviolent protesters, bystanders and medics at risk. [shouting] According to the Gaza Health Ministry, Israeli soldiers have shot over 6,000 Palestinians in the protests of 2018. In Gaza, we saw many with life-changing injuries. More than 180 have been killed. They include a journalist who was filming the protests, a 15-year-old shot in the chest, a 16-year-old who had his arms raised and a young man shot in the back while carrying a tire. And off-camera in August, a senior Israeli commander told us that by then, 60 to 70 Palestinians were killed unintentionally. Israel has opened criminal investigations into three cases, including Rouzan’s. But it’s done nothing to adjust its policy on the use of lethal force. For now, Israel says that protecting its border is a complicated business. “Unfortunately, yes, in a situation like that, accidents happen, and unintended results happen.”	An Israeli Soldier Killed a Medic in Gaza.

These are not scenes from a war zone, but from a religious march and protest in Nigeria’s capital in late October. They show a military unit killing and injuring dozens of members of a religious organization called the Islamic Movement in Nigeria. The military says it acted in self-defense. But we reviewed hundreds of videos collected from witnesses and social media. We interviewed survivors, visited the scene and found that the military story just doesn’t hold up. Here’s how an elite Nigerian battalion turned a religious procession into a massacre and why they got away with it. First, what is the Islamic Movement in Nigeria? It’s a sect of mainly Shiite Muslims who feel discriminated against by the government and don’t recognize the Nigerian Constitution. They’re a tiny minority. The country is mostly Christian and Sunni Muslim. But the government fears that their political activism, while mostly peaceful, could stoke unrest. In October, they gathered in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, for an annual religious procession, the Arbaeen pilgrimage. It’s a symbolic ceremony that’s observed by Shia Muslims around the world. And in Nigeria, it’s a community event where many women and children participate. But they’re also demanding the release of their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky. He’s been detained for three years since a government crackdown on the group, despite a court order to release him. It’s Monday, Oct. 29. The group set out from east of the capital and had already marched for a day and a half without incident, until it reached a military checkpoint on the outskirts of Abuja. It’s a security measure to prevent attacks by the militant group Boko Haram. The marchers have no association with Boko Haram. The military says the marchers stopped traffic and then attacked the checkpoint. But videos show us that traffic is flowing freely along the highway until the military seals it off with a barricade. In this previously unseen footage, the procession’s organizers, here in bright safety vests, approached the checkpoint. Abdullahi Musa was one of them. Let’s watch this scene again. As that man is being shot, other soldiers rush and fire more rounds, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Shortly after, more soldiers arrive and the shooting continues. The military said its soldiers were attacked with firearms and rocks. We see some protesters throw rocks in response to the shooting. But there is no credible evidence that troops were fired upon. Notice, these soldiers do not take cover from gunfire. For most of the incident, they stand in the open, continue to fire into the procession indiscriminately and at short range, and then chase the marchers, shooting at them even as they retreat. In the crowd, people take cover as bullets fly past. Some are carried away with horrific injuries. We’ll take a moment to examine some of these injuries because they indicate a high caliber weapon was used. A warning: These pictures are quite gruesome and we’ve blurred parts of them. Some victims had their limbs completely blown off. These are battlefield wounds and they’re caused by battlefield weapons. We see one right here. Atop this vehicle is a heavy machine gun. It fires .50-caliber rounds, as seen in this archival footage. It’s a weapon normally used in war zones, not to police civilians. Later, we see the dead and injured lying on the road, but no ambulances appear to have arrived at the scene. A few unarmed marchers return and stand in defiance. A protester helps one of the injured to raise his fist. Soldiers approach them from a truck and begin brutally beating them. They’re flung into the back of the vehicle, lashed some more and driven away. The army, beyond any doubt, is not responding to a deadly threat here. The military said three people were killed that day. But we counted at least two dozen bodies in verified photos and videos. Witnesses told us that 39 people were killed. In hospitals, we saw more than 40 young survivors of that weekend’s violence. A bullet shattered this 16-year-old girl’s leg, an injury that her family said is likely to restrict her movement for the rest of her life. Others were shot in the stomach and in the back as they fled. Some were shot in the head. What military unit was responsible for this? Let’s take a second look at this gun truck. It belongs to the Guards Brigade, an elite unit tasked with protecting Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and the capital, Abuja. Here we see it arriving, moving toward the marchers and chasing after the crowd as it retreats. And more soldiers from the Presidential Guard arrive after the attack. They’re wearing its insignia. This logo on the back of the truck tells us they’re the 7th Battalion. It’s one of five units within the guard whose commander reports directly to the head of Nigeria’s armed forces and also coordinates with the president’s top staff. It’s a short chain of command to the head of state. What happened in Abuja is not an isolated incident. In 2015, the army shot and killed nearly 350 members of the same group and dumped their bodies in a mass grave. A judicial panel recommended that soldiers be disciplined. But nothing happened. Two days before this latest shooting, the military killed more people at another march held over the weekend pilgrimage. Again in a brutal fashion. In a phone interview with The Times, military spokesman John Agim didn’t deny the killings. He insisted the marchers intended to occupy the capital, attacked the checkpoint and had to be stopped. Under international law, guns may be used only to protect lives, not to break up protests. Our analysis shows this threshold was not met. But with no accountability, the message is clear: The president’s men are free to act as they please.

You hop out — yo, E, stay in there, all right?” A traffic stop in New York City leads to a young black man being arrested for possession of marijuana. Marijuana laws have relaxed in much of the country. But in New York, there were still 18,000 arrests made last year. Those arrests are rarely contested. But videos provided to The Times by public defenders in this case raise troubling questions about how far officers are willing to go to make an arrest. The N.Y.P.D. told us the officers in this case did not act improperly. Here’s what happened: “Give me your license.” Officers Elmer Pastran and Kyle Erikson stop a BMW in Staten Island in February of 2018. They say the car windows were excessively tinted and the driver turned without signaling. Inside are four young black men. As backup arrives, they search the occupants. Officer Pastran recognizes some of the passengers and tells his partner that they are members of a violent gang from the area. The driver, Lasou Kuyateh, pleaded guilty to an assault in 2016. Erikson searches the passenger side and looks into the rear of the car. Note the rear floor area. This becomes important soon. Erikson moves to the driver’s seat and says he needs to find something incriminating. Just as Erickson says this, his body camera goes off. He later said it had a technical issue. But Pastran’s bodycam continues rolling. He’s searching the rear. Note the floor area again. Later, Erickson would say in court that he found a lit joint in plain view, here. But Pastran, who’s leaning right over the area, doesn’t see anything. A minute later, Erickson enters the rear of the car. He searches the back seat. Remember, his camera is still off. But Pastran’s camera catches Erickson. He appears to be fiddling with something in the back seat, but at no point suggests that he has found anything. The officers chat in the front. They’ve been searching the car for three and a half minutes. The owner of the car, who has a cellphone out, films Erickson holding small plastic bags. We don’t know where the bags come from or what Erickson is doing with them. The driver is handcuffed and his phone is taken from him. Pastran tells another officer that no contraband was found. At the same time, Erickson is inside the car. His bodycam turns back on. It has been off for over four minutes. The first 30 seconds of video have no sound. That’s because police bodycams keep rolling and save a segment of video that’s filmed just before they’re switched back on. The audio begins here, signifying the moment the camera was activated. Let’s rewind. It’s activated just as Erickson discovers evidence. He reaches toward the floor behind the driver’s seat. He comes up holding a joint and claims it’s lit. He believes this allows him to arrest all of the car’s occupants. Police officers are under pressure to make arrests and many would naturally think that four arrests are better than one. But Pastran shoots down the idea. As he’s taken to a police station, the driver, now in handcuffs, talks to Pastran. The driver was charged with possession of marijuana and spent two weeks in jail. During the court hearing, Officer Erickson testified that the joint was lit and in plain view when he found it on the floor. But remember, Pastran declared the area clean. That footage was entered into evidence, and during Erickson’s testimony, the judge intervened. The police department was advised that Erickson should get a lawyer. And in the end, the marijuana case was dismissed and sealed. The N.Y.P.D. told us that internal investigators examined these videos and found no police misconduct. Officer Pastran did not return our calls. And Officer Erickson declined to comment.

Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we’ll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There’s a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven’t seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, ‘We’re going to be fine. Everything’s fine.’ And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don’t have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it’s America, and we’re supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department’s volume is pretty high. It’s about 200 people a day. Now we’re seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren’t necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn’t realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it’s hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We’re exposed over and over again. We don’t have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don’t take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We’re always worried that we’ll be out of N95 masks. What’s a little bit scary now is the patients that we’re getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don’t smoke, they’re healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They’re just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying it’s going to be OK, everything’s fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we’re already this strained, we don’t have what we need. I don’t really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We don’t have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and — and it’s really hard.”	‘People Are Dying’: 72 Hours Inside a N.Y.C.

These Innovators Are Racing to Help.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007046207/coronavirus-innovative-equipment.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	Health care workers around the world are asking for help. “What do you want?” “PPE.” “When do you need it?” “Now.” They’re in desperate need of more PPE, also known as personal protective equipment. Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. “I’ve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there’s an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there’s such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.” The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. “It’s amazing because no one’s asking which country are you from? They’re just like, how can I help? What do you need?” They’re pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He’s an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he’s designing replicable face masks. “We’re focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it’ll hit the face shield rather than them.” Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. “There you go.” Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. “My lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we’ve realized that I don’t have to go that far. It’s in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have — not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It’s just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it’s the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.” “This headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We’re hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.” Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. “So how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?” They’re working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. “We’ve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we’ve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.” This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. “So it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it’s professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we’re making sure that we’re using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.” Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. “We’re creating face shields and we’re creating these different PPEs, and we’re putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.” Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. “It is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there’s an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.” “These are really hard objects to manufacture because you’re going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?” This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. “That was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that’s actually going to be safe and helpful?” Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. “So really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.” But they could become key if critical supplies run out. “We’re in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.” Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. “We don’t want anybody — let’s be clear — to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don’t think, with this initiative that we will get there.” For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. “I just can’t stop. I have to do stuff. And then I’m currently at a hospital. That’s why I have this uplifting little flower portrait. We’re expecting a baby boy, and what do we tell him when he grows up about what we did when society needed us?”	Coronavirus Has Hospitals in Desperate Need of Equipment.

And then, there’s Mexico City. Here, off the bustling Paseo de la Reforma, there’s an unsettling sense of normalcy. Flight attendants, newly arrived from the United States, walk around carefree. “I think on the one hand, it’s refreshing for us because we’re coming from a place that’s taking extreme precautions. We are on a petri dish most of the time, so I might already be exposed — more likely on the plane than probably here.” Mexico has documented four deaths from Covid-19. One man died after attending a large music concert. Doctors say the virus is already spreading in the community. “We don’t have tests, so we are having low numbers of patients that are infected.” Dr. Francisco Moreno oversees nine Covid patients at Mexico City’s ABC Hospital. He’s self-isolating, so I interviewed him remotely. “Do you think Mexico could be as bad as Italy?” But Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has continued to say there is no cause for alarm, and resists the measures other countries have taken to slow the virus’s spread. This was his message in early March. López Obrador, also known as AMLO, has continued to hold political rallies around Mexico, shaking hands and hugging admirers. Other government officials may encourage social distancing, but he asks people to go out and spend their pesos. But according to a recent O.E.C.D. report, Mexico has fewer nurses and fewer intensive care beds per capita than Italy, South Korea and the U.S. A count of ventilators in state facilities revealed only about 2,050 machines in the entire country. International leaders have criticized López Obrador’s response to the crisis as irresponsible. The president of El Salvador even begged Mexico, via Twitter, to take more drastic measures so as not to become the next epicenter of the pandemic.

And every hour, like, things are changing. So it’s just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst — I don’t know. They say in 18 days it’s supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow we’re going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up.” “That’s no problem at all. Thank you very much. That’s very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, they’re not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through.” [Rain falling] “It’s go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry.

Stay safe and have a good day.” “So this is not business as usual. We don’t know what’s coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, it’s something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. We’re just getting them registered. They’re getting food. That’s our main priority is people are getting food.” [Sighing with exasperation] “I’m not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second.” “I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now we’re all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? It’s hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like it’s about to get very desperate.” “This is only something that we can get through if we’re working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if we’re not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being.

trusted	How China Is Reshaping the Coronavirus Narrative	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000007024807/china-coronavirus-propaganda.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	The Chinese government has one of the most extensive propaganda networks in the world inside the country, but it also aggressively works to influence how it’s perceived outside its borders. “Good morning, President Xi!” China has invested billions into bolstering its image abroad. Its state-run news outlets push out messages in English around the clock — “You’re watching CGTN.” “Live in Beijing.” “From Nairobi.” “Washington, D.C.” — and its diplomats have flocked to Twitter in the last year. But what happens when this massive P.R. apparatus has to do major damage control? We analyzed thousands of tweets from Chinese state media and official accounts and found three dominant messages China wants to project to the world. Here’s what we learned. A novel coronavirus hit the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. Early whistleblowers were silenced. People were angry about a government cover-up. But in the majority of tweets we analyzed, state-owned publications pushed a much more optimistic view, promoting what they said was an effective response. They are sharing videos like this. The Chinese Communist Party refers to this as positive energy, only focusing on the bright side of an issue. China did take drastic measures to try and stem the outbreak, but that’s the only story China wants the world to see. And state media is eager to run praise from foreign experts to back up China’s successes. One tweet from state media that did reveal Chinese citizens’ discontent — — it was quickly deleted. Once the virus spread across the world, China started positioning itself as being at the forefront of fighting the pandemic. It presented itself as a partner, a grateful recipient, and more recently a selfless leader, highlighting large donations from Chinese companies and the government. China hasn’t typically disparaged other countries’ responses to the virus, with one exception — the United States. “President Donald Trump has been accused of denying, downplaying and outright rejecting the concerns over the Covid-19 outbreak.” Another thing we noticed are Chinese outlets disputing the origin of the virus. It all started in late February with a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. Around the same time, the C.D.C. reported the first case in the United States with an unknown origin. A screenshot of the announcement incorrectly translated in Chinese began to trend online and was untouched by Chinese government censors. And a high-ranking government spokesperson actively pushed disinformation about where the virus came from. A government giving an optimistic spin to bad news is not unique. “We want to go big, go solid. The country is very strong.

China did take drastic measures to try and stem the outbreak, but that’s the only story China wants the world to see.
And state media is eager to run praise from foreign experts to back up China’s successes.
One tweet from state media that did reveal Chinese citizens’ discontent — — it was quickly deleted.
Once the virus spread across the world, China started positioning itself as being at the forefront of fighting the pandemic."

Bingeing some reality TV show, I can begin to forget why I’m stuck here — until the commercial break. “We’re all living a new normal —” “Especially now.” “Even in times as uncertain as these.” It’s jarring how quickly the realities of the coronavirus have been processed into the optimistic language of advertising. Every crisis inspires its own corporate PSAs, but these ones are strangely ubiquitous. The hallmarks of coronavirus ads are so consistent they could be generated by bots. “People.” “People.” “People.” “People.” “People.” “And family.” They’re all collected in this YouTube montage called, “Every Covid-19 Commercial Is Exactly the Same.” “Especially now.” The ads begin with eerie drone footage of empty streets, a shot of a child staring plaintively out the window, some desperate-looking individual, and then — upbeat musical key change. A medical worker peeling off their mask, a guy jamming on his home piano, a deeply pregnant woman rubbing her stomach as if summoning a genie from a bottle. And finally: “We care about keeping you safe.” “We’re here to help.” “We’re still here for you.” “Our spirit is what unites us.” What’s weird is, I’m not sure what I’m supposed to buy. These ads are often strangely devoid of product placement. Instead, they lean on pat metaphors that stuff the crisis into the various receptacles affiliated with the products. There are no Cokes in this Malaysian Coke ad, just the note, “Thank you for filling the glass with kindness and hope.” Dunkin’ talks about raising a cup. And Hefty’s message compares the human spirit to a bag of trash. “Thank you.” Uber even ran an anti-Uber commercial that tells its customers, “Thank you for not riding with Uber.” In the place of images of products, these ads are selling a vision of the workers who made them. They show Fareway employees striding in slo-mo through stockrooms, and masked warehouse workers monitoring Amazon conveyor belts. “To our over one million heroes —” “To all of our Amazon retail heroes, we want to thank you.” “I say thank you.” They’re capitalizing on the trend of anointing all essential workers as heroes. It’s a well-meaning impulse to thank those people who are stocking shelves and bagging groceries, but employers have seized on it as a tactic to soften the uncomfortable truth that their workers are at risk, and ease our own tensions as consumers about benefiting from their work. “So how does it feel when you see an ad that valorizes a grocery store worker as a hero?” “The word, hero, has always implied having some sort of agency. Somebody running into a burning house and saving a baby, they are making a conscious decision. But we weren’t trained for this kind of thing. This wasn’t in our job descriptions. We’re not these altruistic angels that are just so happy to be there, and to serve you. And that’s kind of what they’re trying to show in these ads. It’s wonderful to be acknowledged. It’s when it becomes a catchphrase, it’s when it becomes ingenuine. It’s like memos from corporate like, ‘You guys are heroes,’ you know? It doesn’t mean anything anymore.” These ads have reimagined their ideal consumers too. Medical workers have swiftly been elevated into unwitting corporate spokesmodels, creating a fantasy where all consumption is reframed as a public service performed by heroes for heroes. In the coronavirus ad world, heroes are broadly defined. They’re not just the nurses and grocery stockers. Now every couch surfer can feel like they’re doing their part. Basically anything a person does during the pandemic can be reframed in a commercial as an act of heroism. It’s telling that so many of these ads are constructed from found images of social media, or at least they’re made to appear that way. They locate hope in amateur video of a woman cutting her own bangs and a baby riding a Roomba. It’s as if by some kind of transitive property, drinking the same brand of coffee that I saw a nurse drink means that I’m contributing to the cause. [sirens] I may not be packing meat or intubating patients, but at least I am bravely maintaining my consumption habits. They make me feel like I’m doing my part by staying on my couch.

I said to the president when this started, “Forget all that.” At the meeting we just had, it was the same way. It was not about politics. It was not about any of that. It was about what — how do we supercharge the reopening, especially in New York, which has been hardest hit? How do we take some of these big infrastructure projects that have been sitting around for a long time — which if we were all smarter and better, we would have done 30 years ago — and actually get them up and running because we have to do this work anyway? And because we need the jobs, now, more than ever. And it was a good conversation. The president’s from New York. So he has a context for all the things we’re talking about. I think the president also acknowledges and realizes that New York — we’re very aggressive about getting these projects done and getting them done on time. This is not the typical government project. We actually get these things done. We’re building the first new airport — at La Guardia — in 25 years in this country. We built the largest infrastructure project in the United States, which was a bridge that went across the Hudson River, now named the Mario Cuomo Bridge. It was the largest infrastructure project in the United States. We got it done on time, on budget. So if he gives us the green light, this is not going to be years of discussion.

You don’t have a boring mask like my mask. I’m a boring guy. They have colored masks. They have masks that say things. Some people coordinate their outfit with the color of their mask. And this has to be part of literally who we are, and what we do every day. That does not mean when someone doesn’t wear a mask we should be rude to that person or be obnoxious to that person, but this has got to be part of every New Yorker’s fashion and design, and clothing and outfitting — wearing the mask — it makes a real difference.

And we have — might as well just say it here — we have to figure out we’re going to do.” “I feel a responsibility to this place, this community. We’re safety net hospital. Said there’s nine in there. Working in the morgue right now, I’m still trying to figure out why God placed me here at this moment. Once I go outside, I’m in a zone with it. It’s set up like an airplane. You looking for somebody there in Section 5, Row D. You couldn’t have told me that we’d have did that a month and a half ago.” My son’s grandfather’s best friend, man. Jesus. One, two, three — stop. One, two, three — all the way. It’s more emotional for me now than it was two months ago. It’s starting to tap into my pain. We got this thing, we man up and get it done. We don’t go to somebody and say, ‘I’m hurting.’ And if we’re going to recover from this correctly, we’re going to have to do that.” “That’s what I don’t know is, how we’re going to move forward. Any update?” “No.” “I was born here in this hospital. My dad was born in this hospital, and all my siblings. In the beginning, I was leaving and crying every day. But thank God, it’s changing. It seems like it’s changing. Mr. Style?” “Yes.” “How are you this evening?” “I feel good.” “You feel good? I’m going to feed you, OK?” “Yes.” “We’re going to start with the soup because I know you like your soups.” “Yes.” “Right? How is that?” “Wonderful.” “I’m going to miss you when you leave me today. You know that? Reach your hand straight, and there’s your teacup.” “OK.” “All right. Put the straw to your mouth. Here’s the straw. OK, close your mouth. Go ahead. Drink. Dealing with Covid, people are scared when they find out that they have that. You don’t want to be the person that’s just running in the room and running back out. What’s most exciting about going home? What are you excited about?” “Oh, sometimes here, I’m just lonely by myself. And when I’m at home, my grandson is with me. I’m comfortable at home. I cannot see, but I can find my way around the house by touching furniture.” “Hey, this is St. John’s calling. Your dad is ready to go now. Somebody’s going home.” “Thank you for everything, OK?” “Yeah. It was a pleasure. I’m excited for you. You’re going home.” “Yeah. Thank you!” “Yes. Thank you.” “All right, thank you.” “I feel like we’ve seen the worst of it. I’m hoping that the numbers don’t go back up. But the reality is that they could. Just dealing with the unknown right now.” “Can we call respiratory? CPAP? It’s time to think, and it is time to work. What’s her SAT? That’s been taught by my dad, my mom. Just in case, set the intubation stuff set up, all right? I hope I’m wrong, but I still think the second wave is coming. I hope I’m wrong.” “You ever hear the saying, men cry in the dark? I’ve cried one time since this happened, and I’ve carried 100 — it’s got to be 150 people out of here. One, two, three. Big, small, men, women, people I know, grew up with them, grew up with their children. One, two, three. I would do everything in my being to make sure that this doesn’t happen again.”	‘Lord Have Mercy’: Inside One of New York’s Deadliest ZIP Codes		['Kassie Bracken', 'Emily Rhyne']	['deadliest', 'going', 'ok', 'right', 'dont', 'im', 'thank', 'feel', 'inside', 'mercy', 'know', 'thats', 'think', 'lord', 'codes', 'zip', 'yorks']	"I don’t think it’s going to hit me for a while.” “I think there’s a feeling, like can we take a breath?
— you don’t know what’s coming through that door.
I don’t think you’re ever prepared for that.” “You know what the saddest thing was?
How is that?” “Wonderful.” “I’m going to miss you when you leave me today.

Here’s How He Did It.	true	[]		trusted	[]	https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007030179/joe-biden-march-primary-results.html	https://www.nytimes.com/	[MUSIC PLAYING] “Good morning.” “Good morning.” “Good morning.” So this is Joe Biden in January of 2017 during his last few weeks as vice president. “Do we know [INAUDIBLE]” He was surprised with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “Hey, guys.” And he was headed home to Delaware. “Back on Amtrak.” Fast forward to the present, and it now looks pretty clear that Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee for president. The path to victory has continued to narrow for Bernie Sanders. So how did we get here? And how did Joe Biden pull it off? The campaign begins after the 2018 midterm elections. “The Democrats will win the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives —” They are determined, more than ever, to take the fight in 2020 to Donald Trump. “You know, the Democrats are AWOL. They’re missing in action.” “Today, I am announcing my candidacy for president —” Biden enters the race as a clear front-runner, lifted by the positive feelings that so many Democrats have about his role during the Obama administration. “I’m— I’m paying for Joe, so don’t take his money.” [LAUGHTER] But there are persistent questions about just how ready he is for a campaign in 2020 and just how effectively he can defend his very, very long record in government. “I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden.” He is on the defensive over and over. “Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?” “No.” Challenged by other candidates. “Are you forgetting—” “It’s automatic to be enforced.” ”—what you said two minutes ago?” Biden’s greatest difficulties come in the first states to vote, Iowa and New Hampshire. And these are places that really reward candidates with strong organization on the ground. Throughout the summer and the fall, we hear, over and over, from people in Iowa and New Hampshire, that Joe Biden does not have that kind of organization. And then the night of the caucuses happened. He comes in fourth place in Iowa. And when the campaign moves to New Hampshire, he fares even worse. He is in fifth place. Much of the political world, essentially, counts out Joe Biden. They see that his fund-raising has dried up. They see that his poll numbers have crashed. “Now we’re going on to South Carolina and win. And now we’re going to take this back.” And Biden’s campaign keep saying, wait until South Carolina, a real turning point. “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, South Carolina.” When that moment of victory came in South Carolina, it seemed to remind millions of people, all at once, of why they liked Joe Biden in the first place and to remind them in a convincing enough way for many of them to change their minds about who they were going to vote for in a matter of days, leading to just a total turnaround in this race. “I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden.” Two major candidates almost immediately drop out of the race. Then comes Super Tuesday. He wins 10 of the 14 states, some of them by absolutely enormous margins. And that’s when Joe Biden goes from being the comeback kid to a strong front-runner once again. “Who’s ready to go to the center of the arena, who is our best shot to beat Donald Trump.” And from there, Joe Biden has only continued to widen his delegate lead. He persuaded the significant majority of Democratic voters that he was, by far, the strongest candidate to oppose Donald Trump in the general election. He put together a powerful coalition that combined some of the most loyal constituencies in the Democratic Party, especially African-Americans and women. “Folks, the vote is in your hands, not a joke. You can control this outcome.” With some of the newer constituencies that have supported Democrats since President Trump’s election, moderate suburban white voters who greatly preferred Joe Biden to Bernie Sanders. Biden has emerged as the likely Democratic nominee at exactly the moment that the coronavirus has brought the campaign almost to a halt. “That means we have to do testing. We have to get the testing kits up and ready.” “And we’ll lead with science.” Biden’s campaign did not run the strongest campaign operationally. He was not a flawless candidate. “Now, now, shush.” But a lot of voters knew him well enough, or felt they did, to look past a lot of that and to embrace him in the end as what they saw as a safe choice. This has been a wild campaign so far. And now, with the coronavirus, there are even more questions arising about the campaign going forward and the election.

Last week, I had the honor of speaking to all of you from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the foundational documents of our democracy. Tonight, in keeping with the latest guidance from the C.D.C. to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, I’m speaking to you from my home in Wilmington, Del. I hope all of you are staying safe, talking and taking the recommended precautions and talking to the doctor, if you have one, to keep your social distance, to slow the spread of this virus. This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives and every aspect of this campaign. Most of all my heart goes out to all of those who have lost a loved one, to those who have contracted the virus, to all the brave Americans who are working harder than ever to help their neighbors, and all those children that are home from school that are worried and don’t know quite why. Doctors, nurses, E.M.T.s and public health officials, as well as the front line emergency workers like firefighters and dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in the grocery stores. You know, tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war. It’s going to require leadership and cooperation from every level of government. And it’s going to require us to move thoughtfully and decisively to quickly address both the public health crisis as well as the economic crisis. It’s going to require us to pay attention to the medical and scientific and health experts. And it’s going to require each of us to do our part. Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it’s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens — make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it. You know, I know we, as a people, are up to this challenge. We always have been. I know that we’ll answer this moment of crisis with the best that we find in all of us, because that’s what Americans always have done, and what we do. That’s who we are. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises. And today we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge. Americans in three states went to the polls today. I want to thank all the public officials and the poll workers, who work closely with the public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting, to clean and disinfect voting booths and to make sure the voters could cast their ballots while maintaining a distance from one another that was safe. You know, it’s important for us to get through this crisis, protecting both the public health and our democracy. Today it looks like, once again, in Florida and Illinois — we’re still awaiting to hear from Arizona — our campaign has had a very good night. We move closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November with strong support from the African-American community, the Latino community, high-school-educated people, like the folks I grew up with in my old neighborhood. Labor, teachers, suburban women, veterans, firefighters and so many more. And we’re doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reduce income inequity that has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. So let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify this party and then to unify the nation. You know, it’s in moments like these, we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican.

We’re all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us, to look out for our neighbor, to understand the fear and stress that so many are feeling, to care for the elderly — the elderly couple down the street — to thank the health care worker, the doctors, the nurses, the pharmacists, the grocery store cashier and the people restocking the shelves, to believe in one another, because I assure you when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we lift this nation up and we’ll get through this together. That’s how we’ve always done it. God bless you all and my special prayer for those of you in the frontlines of the crisis — doctors, nurses, health care workers caring for the virus victims and their families. My prayers are going out for everyone. My hopes are high, because I believe in times of crisis, Americans have always stepped up. We have to step up and care for one another. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening.	‘We’re All in This Together,’ Biden Says		[]	['public', 'need', 'going', 'biden', 'thank', 'care', 'health', 'know', 'crisis', 'require', 'americans']	"Doctors, nurses, E.M.T.s and public health officials, as well as the front line emergency workers like firefighters and dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in the grocery stores.

We’re dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We’re dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact tens of millions of workers in this country. We’re dealing with a political crisis as well. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to people who tonight are worried that they may have the coronavirus, but don’t have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need? So this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together. Most important point is workers need to continue to get a paycheck even when their businesses are shut down. Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families.	‘Workers Need to Continue to Get a Paycheck,’ Sanders Says		['The Associated Press']	['world', 'happens', 'worried', 'country', 'sanders', 'provide', 'paycheck', 'coronavirus', 'workers', 'crisis', 'need', 'dealing', 'continue']	"Our country and, in fact, the world are facing an unprecedented series of crises.

This is an unprecedented moment in American history. Now, I obviously believe in Medicare for all. I will fight for that as president. This coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system.” “I would bring together the leading experts in the world. Instead of doing this piecemeal, sit down and do what we did before, with the Ebola crisis. And with all due respect to Medicare for all — you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for all. That would not solve the problem at all.” “What are you doing to protect yourself?” “Last night we had a fireside chat, not a rally. We’re not doing that right now. I’m not shaking hands. Joe and I did not shake hands. And I am very careful about the people I am interacting with.” “Thank God, for the time being — anything can happen, as my mother would say, knock on wood — that I’m in good health. I’m taking all the precautions anyone would take, whether they’re 30 years old or 60 years old or 80 years old.” “Let me ask you a question, Joe.” “Yeah.” “You’re right here with me.” “Yeah.” “Have you been on the floor of the Senate — you were in the Senate for a few years —” “Yep.” “— time and time again, talking about the necessity, with pride, about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans programs?” “No.” “You never said that?” “No.” “All right, America, go to the website right now. Go to the YouTube right now.” “I did not support any of those cuts — in Social Security or in veterans benefits —” “Whoa, whoa, whoa — everything was on the table. All right. You’re right. You just said it. Including in your judgment, cuts to Social Security and veterans —” “In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related —” “Joe, when you just —” “But I didn’t. But we did not cut it. I did not vote for it.” “I know — because people like me helped stop that. But Joe, you just contradict — Joe, you just contradicted yourself.” “If I’m elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country. And I commit that I will in fact appoint a, pick a woman to be vice president.” “The vice president committed to picking a woman as his running mate. If you get the nomination, will you?” “In all likelihood, I will.” “I would end this notion — for the first time in history, that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river. They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made as to whether or not they qualify.” “I speak as the son of an immigrant. I will end on Day 1 the demonization, the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country. This is a time to move aggressively dealing with the coronavirus crisis, to deal with the economic fallout. But it is also a time to rethink America.” “This is bigger than any individual.

Joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for all bill if it is passed in Congress? Joe, how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system before irreparable harm takes place to this planet because of the ravages of climate change? Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen.

Social media became an effective way to bring widespread attention to how Ms. Bland was treated by police and to her death, as it had following the deaths of several unarmed black men over the past year.

In addition to creating an online campaign, social media users adopted the hashtags #SandraBland and #SayHerName in the days after her death.

Ms. Bland graduated in 2009 from Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Tex., with a degree in agriculture. A memorial service was held there this week for her.

The online activism led to other vigils in Texas and Illinois, and a rally against police violence in New York.

Many of the people who dispute the account of Ms. Bland’s death say that she was a vocal civil rights advocate on social media. In April, she posted a video to Facebook in which she discussed police brutality.

“Black lives matter,” Ms. Bland says to the camera. “They matter.”

“In the news that we’ve seen as of late, you could stand there, surrender to the cops, and still be killed,” she continued.

Two civilians were also wounded.

The attack came near the scheduled end of a rally held to protest the killing of two black men by police officers in Louisiana and Minnesota this week.

People began gathering for the protest at 7 p.m. local time in Belo Garden in downtown Dallas. Near the end of the rally, about 800 people were gathered and about 100 officers were present, the police said.

One suspect was cornered on the second floor of a garage near El Centro College. The police began negotiating with him around 11:45 p.m. During the negotiation, the suspect said that he was upset by the recent police shootings and that he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, Chief David O. Brown of the Dallas police said.

After several hours, negotiations broke down. Police officers and the suspect exchanged gunfire. The police detonated a robot-controlled bomb, killing the suspect.

After Wednesday’s planned launch was postponed due to weather, SpaceX now plans to launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:22 p.m. Eastern time.

If successful, it will be the first crewed spacecraft launch in the United States since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011.

Liftoff · May 27

The Crew Dragon capsule will ride into orbit on a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket. This is the spacecraft’s last demonstration flight before NASA certifies SpaceX to make regular flights to the space station.

In a previous demonstration flight, an unoccupied Crew Dragon docked with the space station in March 2019.

Two Astronauts

NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will be the first to test the Crew Dragon in orbit.

Each astronaut flew twice on the space shuttle: Mr. Behnken in 2008 and 2010, and Mr. Hurley in 2009 and 2011 for the last space shuttle mission.

Seats for Seven

Crew Dragon has more room and can carry more people than the Apollo capsules that flew astronauts to the moon and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that ferry people to and from the space station.

Future flights of the Crew Dragon would carry four astronauts to the station, and the spacecraft can hold up to seven.

Flying By Touch

Crew Dragon also introduces a different interface than previous spacecraft, using a touch screen in place of the many knobs, buttons and switches that once controlled the space shuttle and Apollo spacecraft.

Launch Escape Test · Jan. 2020

In January the Crew Dragon passed a major test of its safety features when an unoccupied capsule separated from its Falcon 9 rocket after liftoff and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean.

The escape system is meant to carry the Crew Dragon capsule to safety if there is a problem with the rocket during launch.

The mission was an end-to-end test of the spacecraft hardware and procedures, and it included the first automatic docking with the space station by an American spacecraft.

Dragon Resupply Missions

A previous, uncrewed iteration of the Dragon capsule — now known as Dragon 1 — resupplied the space station from 2012 to 2020. The final launch of a Dragon 1 cargo capsule was in March.

So I cover immigration in and around New York City, and over the past few months, like everybody, I’ve been covering the coronavirus crisis. And not too long ago, I started looking at how that experience has been different for Latino immigrant families.

[music]

One thing I noticed pretty much right away is that hundreds and hundreds of families were turning to GoFundMe, to the crowd funding site. And they were setting up pages to pay for funerals and hospital bills and also to send their relatives’ remains back to their home countries, to maybe mothers or grandmothers. So I started just sending emails to the people who had created these sites, and one of the first responses I got was from a girl in New Jersey and her twin sister. I got a very polite text saying that they were willing to speak, so I gave them a call. And quickly, I learned that their story was just wrenching.

annie correal Melanie? Melanie, can you hear me? melanie cruz morales Yes.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the experience of immigrant families during the pandemic. Annie Correal with the story of one of them. It’s Tuesday, May 26.

annie correal All right. Hi there, Melanie. How are you? melanie cruz morales Hi. I’m OK. I’m taking every day by day. How are you today? annie correal I’m fine. Thank you.

annie correal

So Sheila and Melanie Cruz Morales, they’re identical twins. They live in Teaneck, N.J., which is a suburb of New York City.

annie correal And tell me a little bit about yourself. How old are you? melanie cruz morales So I am 19 years old. I am a political science major at Bergen Community College. I’m from a Mexican immigrant family, and I am a DACA recipient. Those are a couple things about me.

annie correal

They’re really obviously studious, dedicated, driven young women. And they have a kind of passion for politics that they say they’ve discovered in their early teenage years.

melanie cruz morales Yeah, and we’re both going to transfer somewhere else this fall. annie correal I overheard Sheila in the background. Do you want to — hi, Sheila. sheila cruz morales Hi. Sorry. annie correal That’s OK. Nice to meet you. sheila cruz morales Yeah, it’s nice to meet you.

annie correal

So Sheila, she’s kind of the shy one of the two.

sheila cruz morales I’m usually very quiet and I just let Melanie do the talking.

annie correal

So it’s Melanie, her sister, who tells me the entire story of their uncle Javier. She just lost him to Covid-19.

[music]

michael barbaro

And who is her uncle, Javier?

annie correal

So her uncle Javier, Javier Morales, is the kind of father figure for her whole family.

melanie cruz morales Basically the way we migrated over here to this country really started with my uncle Javier, who he was one of the first ones who planted seeds in this country.

annie correal

You know, he speaks English. He’s more integrated.

melanie cruz morales He basically taught us a lot and prepared us for what life would be like here.

annie correal

And he’s come a long way because he and his family come from this little tiny village of 200 people and shrinking in Oaxaca. It’s called Santa Catarina Yosonotú.

And what’s this village like in Oaxaca?

melanie cruz morales It’s literally a small town in the midst of mountains everywhere.

So Santa Catarina Yosonotú is indigenous. Many people only speak a language called Mixtec.

melanie cruz morales I think one of the smells that always, always brings me back to it is the scent of fire and wood burning.

annie correal

Because people cook the tortillas over wood fires.

melanie cruz morales You know, there’s no stove. There’s not really much electricity.

annie correal

It’s like lost to time.

melanie cruz morales And there’s not much technology. The way that we call my grandmother who lives in a pueblo is by calling the station where they have phones.

annie correal

There’s just a central call center.

melanie cruz morales Because no one else has phones there.

annie correal

Where someone comes onto the loudspeaker and announces.

melanie cruz morales “It’s Lourdes. I’m calling for Señora Francesa.” And then it’s just funny because my mom is, like, on the phone for five minutes waiting for Grandma to rush down to the center and pick up the phone call.

michael barbaro

So this town is small enough that when an announcement is made over some loudspeaker, everyone in town can hear it.

annie correal

That’s right.

melanie cruz morales It’s a very small town.

annie correal

So in this village, there’s one little grocery store that everyone goes to. This is where you’d go for your beans and rice and Coca-Cola. And this is where uncle Javier worked when he was young, along with his seven siblings. It was the family business.

melanie cruz morales Because everybody would come to the store to buy things, and that’s how everyone knows my family back home.

annie correal

But when Javier was about 18, his father died tragically, and that’s why he left and went to the United States to begin supporting his rather large family.

[music]

michael barbaro

So where in the U.S. did he go?

annie correal

He goes first to California, and he works in the fields. He works as an agricultural worker and eventually travels over to Florida before going up to Teaneck, N.J. And there he found a job for a trucking company, called Cort. He starts driving — they supply furniture for big events like the Super Bowl one year and conventions at the Javits Center in New York City. And so he gets to know the whole country as he makes these trips. And in the process, he seems to sort of fall in love with the United States. He finds an apartment building, and he slowly starts telling his relatives, there’s a lot of opportunity here. Why don’t you come? So slowly, some cousins come over, more and more people, his best friend. Javier’s baby brother, Martin, comes over when he’s about 18, and they move into the apartment complex that he’s found for them. And eventually, the twins, Melanie and Sheila, come over with their mother when they’re about four years old.

melanie cruz morales Just like a lot of other migrants, we crossed the border.

annie correal

They walk across the desert from Mexico into Arizona and travel by car to New Jersey.

melanie cruz morales It’s funny because I vividly remember coming off Route 80.

annie correal

Even though they were so little, Melanie remembered pulling off Route 80 and driving up to what would become her new home, this apartment complex in this unfamiliar new country, and the first person she sees is her uncle Javier, who greets them with open arms.

melanie cruz morales And that’s the first time I really got to meet my cousin and uncle. So they were already here. They were just waiting for us. annie correal So you created like a little second village in Teaneck, N.J.? melanie cruz morales Yeah, we really did. We all realized that this is where we would all be able to have a better life, and little by little over time, we have made it our home. Yeah.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what is this new home, this apartment complex in Teaneck, N.J., like?

annie correal

So they really come to love this building.

melanie cruz morales So our apartment building, that we’ve lived in for 15 years, is three stories. And outside of it is brick, so it stands really strong, and it’s up on a hill. And in the back of the apartment building, there’s this really, really, really big parking lot.

annie correal

There’s a big parking lot outside where they grill meat and sit around on Sundays. The men sit around on their one day off per week, and they listen to music and have a couple of beers, and no one minds because everyone’s family.

melanie cruz morales And the parking lot is where everyone would see each other at least once a day, and we would stop and smile and wave at each other, catch up. And it was also where all the little kids who lived in the apartment building would come out to play.

annie correal

You walk inside, and there’s a central staircase.

melanie cruz morales Which leads you to the second floor, and that is where my uncle Javier used to live. On the third floor is my apartment, and then directly across is where my cousin Kobe and his two little siblings and my aunt and my uncle Martin also lived.

annie correal

Everyone calls each other tío and tía.

melanie cruz morales I said hi, tío, and he said hi.

annie correal

Uncle and aunt.

melanie cruz morales Our apartment had always the doors open because we all knew each other.

annie correal

They go back and forth between each other’s apartments. The doors are unlocked. You know, they’re constantly passing each other in the stairwells, knocking on the door and asking for salsa or soda.

melanie cruz morales We always knew that my uncle Javier always had soda stocked up. So we would go rushing down to his apartment building and tell him, “Hey, do you want to come up and have dinner with us? And bring soda.” And he would always come upstairs with anything that we needed.

michael barbaro

Sounds pretty idyllic.

annie correal

Yeah, I mean, it’s really been home.

melanie cruz morales A lot of people say that when you rent an apartment, it’s always very temporary, and you don’t really feel at home, but that place, for some reason, always, always felt like a forever type of situation. Sometimes in the night when I would be speaking to my sister and my brother, we’d all come around. And I told them, one day when we have money, and we have our careers, and we’re grown, I would like to come back to this place. And I would like to purchase a building with you, with my sister, with my brother, and have it as a place for the family because it was that special to us.

michael barbaro

And what was Melanie and her sister’s relationship like with their uncle Javier?

annie correal

So I think they had a special bond with their uncle Javier. In some ways, he recognizes a lot of promise in them. When he became a US citizen, he actually asked Melanie to sit down with him, and they made flashcards so he could study for his citizenship exam.

melanie cruz morales I would ask him, who was the first president of the United States? And he would tell me the answer, and I guess that was one of the times where we really bonded.

annie correal

And she remembered that as a kind of funny role reversal because she was 9, 10 years old, and there she was trying to teach her uncle who the country’s first president was.

melanie cruz morales It was a bunch of him just getting the wrong answers or him getting the right answers and me being so surprised by it.

annie correal

He really believed in them and thought that they were on a path to success. They were trying to transfer to a four-year college, and he was constantly checking in with them and asking them where they wanted to go and what they wanted to be. At some point, he delivers furniture to Yale University, and he sees the Gothic campus and the beautiful old buildings, and it makes an impression. He comes back, and he tells the twins, “That’s the kind of place where you should go.”

melanie cruz morales He came back and he showed me, “Look, this is the school.” He showed so many pictures. He was like, “I really liked it. I hope that one day that you can go to a school like this.”

annie correal

He’s a real believer in the American dream, and he passes that on to his nieces.

[music]

So he passes the test, and he obtains citizenship status. And that means a lot of things. I mean, for him, it means he can travel back to his village and see his mother. And having a citizen in the family is so important. There are things you never think of.

melanie cruz morales I felt in a way safer to know that I had an uncle who was a citizen, you know, simple little things like me hopping into his car and him driving. And me knowing that he had a license meant the world to me just because of how on edge you are as an undocumented person.

annie correal

And because he’s legally on the books working for this trucking company, he has a salary, he has vacation time, he has paid sick leave.

michael barbaro

And these are things that many of the people living in that apartment complex, many of his relatives don’t have.

annie correal

Exactly. I mean, at the time, none of them, no one had citizenship. So he’s only 48, but he has really become kind of the central figure of the family. He’s also really the heart of the family.

archived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales (LAUGHS) It’s so funny. He liked a lot of Mexican bands, corridos, a lot of banda. He was so proud of it, and he loved to show it off, and it’s like a little joke in our family. archived recording (JAVIER SINGING) melanie cruz morales I’ll never forget, I think it was his birthday three years ago or two years ago, and there’s this one song that you sing when you’re heartbroken, when you just got like broken up with. And we had, like, the microphone, and like, everyone in the tiny little apartment was enjoying it, had a good time, and it was literally like being in a little concert. But everyone was so into it, like even the little kids, even the teenagers, like my cousin, sometimes we think they we’re too cool for our culture, that we’re too Americanized, but in that moment, everyone was just enjoying it. And it was just really, really nice, because he was so happy, and everyone was really happy.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Annie, what happens to this family over the past few months?

annie correal

So this year, Javier goes on his annual trip to Mexico in early March to see his mother, and he comes back and goes straight back to work at the trucking company. And not long after, he starts to feel sick. And you know, he thinks it’s just a cold, but he’s watching the news and all these reports about the coronavirus, and he decides to self-quarantine. Again, you know, he has a job that offers him paid sick leave. So he stops working, and you know, he’s pretty sure it’s nothing to worry about, but it’s better to be safe, and it doesn’t go away.

[music]

So he goes to the closest hospital, to Teaneck. He describes his symptoms. He tells them what kind of work he does and that he’s just traveled, and he asks to take a test, and he’s turned away. He’s told he probably has the flu, and he should rest, take some medicine, and he’ll get better. So he goes home, and the next day he wakes up, and he’s still sick. In fact, he’s even sicker than the day before. And he starts to get a little frightened, so he goes to another doctor, and they tell him the same thing. So it’s now been two attempts, and his symptoms are getting worse. So he does hear that there’s a new testing site in New Jersey at a community college, but he goes on a day when they’re only testing first responders, like doctors and nurses, and he didn’t know that. So they turned them away. And at that point, he’s really scared.

melanie cruz morales So he had no other option but to go to another hospital in Hackensack.

annie correal

So he drives to the hospital in Hackensack, N.J., that same day, and he goes straight to the E.R., and finally, he gets admitted.

melanie cruz morales He went there, and he basically told my aunt he, told them, “Oh, I’m here, I’m OK, don’t worry, and I’ll call you back later.” And that was last time my aunt was ever able to speak to him.

michael barbaro

So this is his fourth attempt to get a test.

annie correal

That’s right, and it’s on this visit where he finally gets tested, and he tests positive for Covid-19.

melanie cruz morales They realized that he was in critical condition, so they moved him up to the I.C.U. and immediately put him on a ventilator. And all the events really happened so fast, nobody could have thought that he would have contracted the virus. We see it on the news, and we see what’s going on, but it doesn’t hit you until it hits home. And then that’s when the reality starts to settle in.

annie correal

The whole family is just worried to death. Then, a few days later, Javier’s baby brother, Martin, starts to feel a little sick himself.

melanie cruz morales When I found out that my uncle, who lived right across from me, was sick, I really couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a joke. Like, I thought there’s no way that two family members could possibly have this virus. And so I called my little cousin Kobe, and I told him, “What’s going on, is your dad OK?” And he said, “Yes, he’s fine. He’s just showing flu-like symptoms.”

annie correal

The thing is, he’s younger than Javier. He’s 39. He cycles every day. He loves riding his bike to the George Washington Bridge. He keeps in really good shape. And so when he gets sick, no one is really all that worried. And he decides that after having seen everything that his brother went through, he’s not going to jump through those hoops. He, unlike his brother, is undocumented. So he thinks, if that was what my brother went through, what’s it going to be like for me?

michael barbaro

So he thinks, since I’m undocumented, what would be my chances of ever getting tested or treated efficiently, so he just basically does nothing.

annie correal

Exactly. So he goes into isolation in a room in his apartment, in this complex, where the whole family lives.

melanie cruz morales My dad rushed over and made a huge pot of home remedies. He made tea. He made onion, garlic, ginger, a bunch of things mixed together, and he packaged it up and dropped it off right in front of his door, of my uncle Martin’s door. And he gave it to him, and that’s basically all that my uncle was taking, because I don’t think he understood this virus. I don’t think anybody did and especially not us.

annie correal

So meanwhile, Uncle Javier is still in the Hackensack hospital. His family is getting regular reports, even some reports that he’s stable.

melanie cruz morales He had been in the I.C.U. for seven days, a week total. And on the last day, we got the phone call.

annie correal

On Monday, April 6, they learned that uncle Javier has died. His heart has stopped.

[music]

So the night after Javier has died, the twins and their big brother, they’re having dinner, and they go and they get some tequila, and they’re about to raise a glass to their uncle Javier.

melanie cruz morales We were in our living room playing Mexican music. And we had — my brother opened a bottle of Patron because my uncle Javier had just passed away, and we wanted to take a shot of tequila and honor him because it was his favorite drink.

annie correal

When they hear someone banging on the door. And they go to the door without opening it, and it’s their cousin Kobe. It’s Martin’s son. He’s 16, and he’s shouting for help.

melanie cruz morales “Help! Help! Call the ambulance. My dad is unresponsive.”

annie correal

So Martin, who was doing OK and trying to get through this at home, is suddenly unconscious.

melanie cruz morales I called the ambulance.

annie correal

So Melanie calls 911.

melanie cruz morales I had to lock my mom and my dad in my room.

annie correal

The twins’ mother is immunocompromised, so they’re very nervous that she could get sick. And so when Kobe comes to the door and bangs on the door and says, “My dad is unconscious, he’s unresponsive,” they don’t even open the door.

annie correal Did you let him into your apartment? melanie cruz morales No.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. I have to imagine that that was really hard for the twins and for everybody, I mean, given what an open household this was. People going in and out of each other’s apartments all the time, and suddenly, a locked door and cousins who won’t let somebody in.

annie correal

Absolutely. I think it’s something that the twins are still struggling with now.

melanie cruz morales It was the hardest thing I had to do, but I knew that my mom’s immune system is so weak that I wasn’t going to risk putting her in danger. So I just said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but I can’t.” It was just a fight or flight reaction.

annie correal

I think it added a layer of just horror to be listening to all of this over the phone or even through the wall.

annie correal So you call 911, and you’re just waiting for the ambulance.

annie correal

So they have Kobe, their cousin, on one line, the paramedics on the other. And the ambulance arrives. And they’re guiding them over the phone through the apartment complex, so they can get to the right door.

melanie cruz morales We were kept on the line. So we heard everything through that phone call. We might have not been there, we might have not been able to see it, but we definitely heard it.

michael barbaro

And what are they hearing as they’re guiding these paramedics in and as the paramedics arrive across the hall?

annie correal

So they’re hearing them run up the stairwell and go into the apartment, and they’re pressed against the door and against the wall.

melanie cruz morales I had to comfort my cousin through the phone. I had to hear his yell. I could hear everything.

annie correal

They hear their cousin Kobe talking to his father, and he’s saying to him, “Don’t go, come back.” And at some point, he’s overcome, and he just throws the phone. And they can’t hear anymore what’s going on, except for these muffled sounds, these panicked sounds as they try to revive Martin.

melanie cruz morales We hear the yells and the cries, and we knew what was going on.

annie correal

And you have to imagine that his wife and his two young children are also in the apartment at the same time. So the twins are waiting. They say that it’s just the worst 25 minutes of their life. And then there’s silence. And they look through the peephole, and they see the body taken down the stairs.

melanie cruz morales The people from the funeral home come and dragged my uncle’s body down the stairs, and that definitely changes a person. There’s nothing that will prepare you for that. And I was left cold. I was left numb. I couldn’t cry. There was no tears coming down my face because I had never ever processed something like that. Our lives completely changed.

michael barbaro

That’s horrible.

annie correal

It is. But then the twins learned that the neighbors who lived across the hall from Javier on the second floor, they’re sick, too.

melanie cruz morales So when we heard that that family who lived across my uncle Javier was also getting sick, that’s immediately when I went into full panic mode and said I have to get out of here.

annie correal

It starts feeling like the coronavirus is just ripping its way through the building.

melanie cruz morales It felt like I was literally trapped in something that I couldn’t get out of, and it just felt like I needed to get out. Like I want — we all did. Like, my mom, my dad, my brother, like everyone felt the need to leave.

annie correal

And so they start planning some sort of escape. Through a connection, they find a home out in rural Pennsylvania, and they just start throwing things literally out the window.

melanie cruz morales We were throwing bags of clothes outside our window because we weren’t going to risk getting anything caught, like in the air of like the staircase, how like they had to pull my uncle’s body down through the stairs, and like we were just so panicked.

annie correal

Their refuge and their family home has turned into what feels like a death trap.

melanie cruz morales We felt like the virus was every corner. So it was survival. It was running for your life.

annie correal

And so they are just gathering everything that they can and fleeing into a car and eventually making their way out into the farmlands of Pennsylvania.

michael barbaro

Do the twins have any idea how this happened, how Javier got sick, whether he may have passed it on to his brother Martin, and then onto the others in the apartment?

annie correal

It’s all kind of speculation. I mean, he traveled to Mexico, so they think, was it making his way back to New Jersey? Could it have been on one of his work trips? Was it maybe Martin who picked it up as he continued to work? There’s really no way to trace how it made it into the apartment complex and why it hit them so hard. Another thing that has really struck me as I’ve talked to many, many families in the immigrant communities of New York and New Jersey is that many people who have been hospitalized or died, they didn’t even know if they had pre-existing conditions because they never sought out a doctor or treatment unless it was really an emergency that you’d go to the emergency room for, like an accident or a broken leg. They would just kind of soldier on.

michael barbaro

But what seems so striking to me about Javier is that he was attentive to his health. He tried over and over again to get a test, and it was such an ordeal. There were so many obstacles.

annie correal

I mean, it’s maddening looking back, and I think it’s worth keeping in mind that that’s what a lot of people were experiencing, whether they were immigrants or not, citizens or not. People were kind of groping around in the dark and not understanding how this virus worked or how quickly it could become a critical illness. I think what is interesting, though, is that in this family, one man died in the hospital, and although his life wasn’t saved, he had doctors and nurses and people checking his oxygen. And the other man stayed at home and drank home remedies of ginger and garlic and never saw a doctor at all. And I think you have to multiply that scenario by many, many thousands to understand why it will be a long time before we begin to grasp the effect on the marginalized communities in America, including the undocumented, because so many people died at home.

michael barbaro

Hm. Of course, the irony here is that the man in the hospital, the man at home — having the privileges that one brother did, citizenship, health care, access to a hospital, it didn’t seem to make a difference.

annie correal

Right. And that’s the irony, that the outcomes were the same.

[music]

michael barbaro

Annie, I wonder how the twins are making sense of all this. I mean, this uncle that they idolized and who had such a vision for what America could be for the family and who did everything right, he was not protected from this virus.

annie correal

Yeah, I think that that’s a challenge that they’re grappling with because I don’t suggest that these young women are naive at all. But I think seeing this, seeing it firsthand that their uncle who did everything that one is supposed to do, the fact that he still somehow fell through the cracks and that he wasn’t seen right away, I think it created a lot of confusion and maybe even disillusionment. This sense of their community was still somewhat on the margins even when they tried to do everything right.

[praying in spanish]

michael barbaro

Annie, when did you last speak with the twins, and how are they doing?

annie correal

So the last time I spoke with them was in the first weeks of May, and they had been living out there in rural Pennsylvania just with their brother and their parents and staying far away from everyone else.

[praying in spanish]

annie correal

So Melanie tells me that every day, they gather for a prayer circle. And one recent evening, they’d had a really hard day.

melanie cruz morales Some days, we have really bad, sad days. And that day was just sad.

annie correal

And the twins are really asking themselves, what are we even doing here?

melanie cruz morales Within this pandemic, we’ve been reflecting our entire life and time here in the United States and really saying, is it worth it? Why are we even here?

annie correal

So that night, Sheila asks God for some sign.

sheila cruz morales I don’t ask for much, but I need a sign to keep going.

annie correal

And later that night, Melanie gets an email. There’s an update from Georgetown.

melanie cruz morales And I was like, oh my god, like, I’m not ready to hear any news whatsoever anymore. Like, throw the whole phone away. I don’t want to see it. So I said, just me and Sheila and my brother are going to be in our room, and we’re going to open our decision. And I opened my notification first, but in that moment, I really, really forgot how to read, and I couldn’t understand anything until — it took me like a good minute for me to finish reading the letter, and then that’s when I started screaming. And I started crying. And I was, like, “I got in.”

annie correal

She’s been admitted to her first choice and been invited to transfer to Georgetown to finish her four year degree.

melanie cruz morales Then my sister checked her phone at the same time, and she also started screaming. And then we were both like, “Oh my god,” we both got in. And it was the happiest day that my family and I had had in the longest time because we had done everything to make this possible, and we had forgotten about it for a second because of this pandemic. But like I said, it was always in the back of my mind. And it was a sign.

annie correal

So suddenly, they go from, you know, sort of having to be the adults in the family to getting to be excited 19-year-olds again.

melanie cruz morales Dear Melanie, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that the committee of admissions has admitted you to Georgetown University. I am happy to offer you a place at the university beginning in the fall of 2020. This year, the committee —

annie correal

They also saw it, as I understand it, as a bit of encouragement from their uncle Javier, because for all of the obstacles, he was a believer in the possibilities. And we all have to make sense of the things that happen to us one way or another. So whatever it means, it does offer them a little bit of relief, a sense that the future might hold good things in this country.

michael barbaro

Not just awful things.

annie correal

Not just awful things.

melanie cruz morales One time in the summer, I was with him outside in the parking lot, and he was asking me about all these schools, and then he asked me, “Where do you want to go after you graduate from Bergen?” And I told him “I want to go to this really good school in Washington D.C. It’s called Georgetown. Bill Clinton went there, all these senators, congressmen, they all went there.” And he was like, “Wow, I know one day you’re going to do it. I know that you and your sister are going to get in, and the day that you get accepted, I’m going to post it on my Facebook and brag to all my friends that I have really smart nieces.” annie correal So did you post on your Facebook so that his family could see and the family could see in Mexico? melanie cruz morales Yeah, I posted it. I know that my uncle knew. And I know that he was with me that day. And I know that he’s proud and he believed in me and my sister. So it’s been hard, but I know that he’s with us, and that gives me comfort. I never understood what people meant when they say — when they talk about when someone passes away, and they’re like, “They’re with you, you can feel them.” But that night, I completely felt my uncle with me.

[music]

annie correal Well, again, I want to thank you for your tremendous generosity with your time and your experience. And I know that it’s hard and not easy. So I hope after this two and a half hour call, that you will breathe some fresh air and be with your family. melanie cruz morales Yes, I definitely will. But thank you again for giving me an opportunity to tell our story and document this. And I know that 10 years from now on, where I’ll be able to look back as this and, whichever position I am able to be, that our story will help define the history and the moments that we are going through right now. annie correal Thank you again, Melanie. melanie cruz morales You’re welcome. Have a good night. annie correal Bye bye.

[music]

michael barbaro

The Mexican government said that as of last week, close to 650 Mexican nationals have died from the coronavirus in the New York City area, by far the highest toll anywhere in the U.S. Sheila and Melanie have reached their goal of raising $30,000 to send their uncles’ remains back to Mexico. But for now, their ashes are still sitting inside of a church in New Jersey.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Here’s what else you need to know today. Over the holiday weekend, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus reached nearly 100,000, a staggering milestone that the Trump administration at one point had predicted would never be reached.

archived recording A month ago, you and President Trump were both talking about a total of 60,000 Covid-19 deaths. Early this coming week, we’re going to reach 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus, and those models that you’re citing now talk about close to 150,000 deaths by August. What happened, doctor? archived recording (deborah birx) I think a few things are together —

michael barbaro

In interviews on Sunday, White House pandemic coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx was asked about what turned out to be an inaccurate estimate of the death toll from the White House.

archived recording (deborah birx) So from the beginning, and I think when we had that first briefing, we talked about 1.2 million to 2.4 million and 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing to this incredibly aggressive virus. Those are the figures that we continue to stand by in this first wave.

michael barbaro

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has banned travel from Brazil because of the outbreak there, adding the country to a growing list of nations, including China, the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, whose residents can no longer enter the U.S.

archived recording (mike pence) What you hear the president saying today is just a very reasonable request of the governor of North Carolina. We all want to be in Charlotte. We love North Carolina. But —

michael barbaro

On Monday, the president and vice president threatened to pull the Republican National Convention out of North Carolina this summer because the governor there cannot ensure full attendance under the state’s social distancing rules.

archived recording (mike pence) I think the president is absolutely intent on ensuring that, as we see our nation continue to make steady progress on putting the coronavirus epidemic in the past, that come this August, we’ll be able to come together in a safe and responsible venue and renominate President Donald Trump for four more years.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: From the earliest days of the coronavirus, health officials believed that it largely spared children and teenagers, but recently that belief has been challenged. My colleague Pam Belluck on the story of a 14-year-old boy whose case is being studied to better understand the impact of the virus on children. It’s Thursday, May 21. Pam, when does this understanding that we all seem to have about the coronavirus and how it spares children, when does that start to change?

pam belluck

In late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said we’re noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms of inflammation. We don’t really know what this is about. Some have tested positive for coronavirus. Some haven’t. And it was just kind of saying we think we’re seeing something. So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided, well, we don’t really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number of cases. We can’t even say for certain that it’s connected to coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch it. And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital in New York City. The person said we’ve got two cases of this syndrome that they’ve been talking about in the UK. If you want to talk to somebody, let us know. And that’s how I got to know Jack McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this visit.

pam belluck

It’s a very warm, kind of cozy apartment. There are all these “welcome home” banners and balloons for Jack. And the family, Jack and his father John and his mother Doris, they just immediately welcomed me and our photographer Gabriela in, and they all just start talking. I just know immediately I have to put on my tape recorder because there’s no way I’m going to capture all this writing things down.

john mcmorrow He sent him a letter. jack mcmorrow Yes. Can I explain something — john mcmorrow Oh, come on. I’m giving backdrop here. You can explain all you want. jack mcmorrow No. First of all, I wanted to talk about how the virus was behaving like a bacteria. john mcmorrow OK, you’re gonna, but I just want to say — jack mcmorrow That was way back when. john mcmorrow — Randall — jack mcmorrow This thing’s probably not picking up anything. doris stroman I hope you know she’s taping all of you because — john mcmorrow Yeah, we barter like this all day long. doris stroman I got a bell from school — jack mcmorrow Stop with the bell. doris stroman — because they bicker. And I have to do this — john mcmorrow And it’s a timeout bell. doris stroman — and tell them to both go to each corner. jack mcmorrow I’m sorry about all this chaotic — pam belluck It’s wonderful. It’s wonderful. [bell ringing] john mcmorrow And these cleaned arteries, they have to bring you right back. jack mcmorrow I was coherent at this time. john mcmorrow No, I know. But I know you’ve been jumping things, and I know when you’re excited. jack mcmorrow Me jumping things? pam belluck You’re doing great. You’re doing great. jack mcmorrow Dad, you went from day one to me in the new I.C.U. That’s like a — doris stroman Do I need to get my bell? jack mcmorrow — huge jump. Dude, if — speaker Oh my God.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this family. Who are they?

pam belluck

So Jack’s father is John McMorrow.

john mcmorrow I know it’s your story, son.

pam belluck

He is a truck driver. He works as a Teamster for the film industry. He was recently laid off because of the pandemic. And his mother, Jack’s mother, is Doris Stroman. She works at a lab school with five and six-year-old kids. She was wearing a mask that had The Rolling Stones tongue logo on it.

doris stroman — to figure out what was going on, starting with his pediatrician.

pam belluck

And Jack is 14. He’s a ninth grader. He goes to Catholic school in Queens.

jack mcmorrow Yeah, and I have a whole bunch of other prop replica stuff. pam belluck So you’re a Star Wars fan? jack mcmorrow I like Marvel a lot more than I do — pam belluck Oh, you’re more of a Marvel person. OK. jack mcmorrow This is the Infinity Gauntlet from “Avengers: Infinity War.” I really have to — doris stroman They don’t have time for that, Jack. jack mcmorrow This is why —

michael barbaro

And, Pam, what is the story that Jack and his parents tell you about this mysterious condition that he has?

pam belluck

So Jack was living the world of a New York City teenager in a pandemic.

doris stroman He never left the house. jack mcmorrow I haven’t left — john mcmorrow Since March 13, he’s been in the house. doris stroman You never left the house. His school — john mcmorrow In his room, not even in here. doris stroman His Catholic school was one of the first that were closed. pam belluck Oh wow. doris stroman Didn’t leave the house.

pam belluck

March 12 was his last day of school, and he was doing the online learning thing.

doris stroman The one time he left the house other than — was to help me with the laundry and didn’t want to touch anything. jack mcmorrow I took a shower after I came up from the laundry room. doris stroman Yeah, the kid just — jack mcmorrow I’m a germophobe.

pam belluck

They just kind of stayed in. He was playing video games. He was chatting with his friends and that kind of thing. That was Jack’s world.

[music]

Then in mid-April, Jack’s parents start to notice some unusual things.

john mcmorrow Three weeks ago, he came out to me with a rash on the backside of his hands. jack mcmorrow Yeah. john mcmorrow I thought it was — jack mcmorrow It was bad. john mcmorrow — from the antibacterial soap. You know, Purell. Maybe he’s doing it too much. He’s sensitive. jack mcmorrow Yeah, for like — we thought it was nothing more than eczema. john mcmorrow And then I think a day or two later he — jack mcmorrow No, it was like — john mcmorrow — your mother told you something about your eyes. She thought you were playing video games too much. jack mcmorrow Yeah, the eyes definitely, but I don’t know if that was —

pam belluck

They went on, and then the next week — and this was April 21 —

jack mcmorrow I had got a normal fever, like 101, 102.

pam belluck

— Jack gets a fever.

jack mcmorrow I woke up one day with — doris stroman Sore throat. jack mcmorrow — sore throat. That was the first inflammation symptom that we had, which was — doris stroman On his hands, on his feet — jack mcmorrow On my hands, on my feet — doris stroman — on his neck. jack mcmorrow — and on my neck. That was the first —

pam belluck

And then around Friday, April 24, things start to get more severe.

jack mcmorrow That ended up being a swollen lymph node that grew to about the size of a tennis ball that you could visibly see coming on the side of my neck. doris stroman That was alarming.

pam belluck

By the next day, Saturday morning, he wakes up and he’s got a 104.7 fever.

michael barbaro

That is a real fever.

pam belluck

That is a serious fever. They call their pediatrician at 7:30 in the morning, and she says, you guys, you got to get to an urgent care clinic, and they do. And there he gets a coronavirus test, but it’s going to be a couple days before he gets the results.

michael barbaro

So at this point they think it might perhaps be Covid-19.

pam belluck

It doesn’t look like Covid-19, but we’re living in a world of Covid-19, and so I think that they are just sort of saying, well, let’s just test him. We don’t really know what this is. They send him home. Things just keep getting worse and worse. And by Monday morning, Jack wakes up. He cannot move. He can’t move.

jack mcmorrow Because I wake up, and to even sit up, I screamed for them. And I had 105 almost.

pam belluck

And he’s lying on the couch.

jack mcmorrow I was sleeping with my socks on, and he kind of saw red. And he takes off my socks to reveal my entire feet, right here, had just rashes on the insides and bottom. doris stroman At that time — jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman — we thought that was the apex. jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman But it wasn’t until days later. jack mcmorrow Yeah, they thought that was bad. My hands here on my palms, a little bit at the back, all rashes. So my skin — to even touch my skin and feel —

pam belluck

It’s terribly, terribly frightening. And he says to me, I was very emotional.

jack mcmorrow I’m using the word emotional to try and cover up the fact I was crying like a baby. It was so bad.

pam belluck

They happen to have a home blood pressure monitor, so they take his blood pressure. And this is where, as if all of these symptoms weren’t alarming enough and frightening enough, the blood pressure is very low. And so they know they had to take him to the hospital. They had to figure out how to get him out of the house. He can’t move. So John and Jack kind of demonstrate this for me.

jack mcmorrow I put my hands on his arms like this and, not kidding, shuffled my way. john mcmorrow And I had to then hold him up — jack mcmorrow With his arms.

pam belluck

John picks him up, puts Jack’s feet on top of John’s feet, and then walks backward out the apartment door, sort of shuffling Jack along.

doris stroman And when we got to the hospital — john mcmorrow They took a wheelchair. doris stroman — they took a wheelchair. jack mcmorrow Yeah, I took a wheelchair. doris stroman He couldn’t walk. john mcmorrow He couldn’t walk no more. He couldn’t bend his legs.

pam belluck

So he gets to the hospital. They are trying to figure out, again, what’s going on. They don’t know.

john mcmorrow — everything back and forth. You had a cardiologist department. You had the pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts, and then you had the immunology all throwing numbers and prescriptions and how they count through each other to deal with him. And this is stuff that I — it’s French to me. You might as well just tell me —

pam belluck

And while he’s there, they get the coronavirus test results back from the clinic that he went to on Saturday two days earlier.

michael barbaro

And what does it say?

pam belluck

They’re negative. So they’re crossing that off the list. They say, we really should probably send you home because we don’t really know what this is, and we think maybe you can just kind of watch it at home.

doris stroman Because they were riding the wave that he tested negative.

pam belluck

Well, Doris is not happy about that. She says —

doris stroman And I said, well, he needs to be tested again. And she said, we only test those who are admitted. And I said, well, then he needs to be admitted. We have nowhere to be —

pam belluck

So there’s a communication around that. And they agree there’s no harm in doing another coronavirus test. Why not? We don’t really know what’s happening. Why not? So they do another coronavirus test. And then while they’re there waiting, another symptom emerges.

doris stroman When he woke up, his eyes were like this. And I was just like, what just — jack mcmorrow Yeah, they were rolling in the back of my head. doris stroman And they were red.

pam belluck

His eyes turned bright red. As his mom is telling me about this, she is pointing to a red pillow on their couch, and she says, it’s like this. And his eyes are rolling back into his head, and they’re bright red.

doris stroman He was like, I’m fine, I’m fine, like this. I’m fine. I’m fine. john mcmorrow When was this?

pam belluck

Then the doctor comes in and tells them that, guess what? The new coronavirus test, the second one, it was positive.

michael barbaro

Pam, how could that be that he has a negative test and just a few days later, suddenly a positive test?

pam belluck

Well, unfortunately this is kind of the reality of coronavirus testing right now that they are not 100 percent reliable. It’s a little bit of a Wild West situation. So there are cases of false negatives, and that’s obviously what was the case with Jack. So once they realize that he is Covid positive, they decide at that hospital that he’s got to go to a children’s hospital. And Jack is not on board with this. He does not want to go. And the doctor says to him, “If I send you home today, you will be dead by tomorrow.”

jack mcmorrow That, I would say, had scared me to death. But it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight.

pam belluck

So Jack gets to the children’s hospital in the ambulance. And the doctors take one look, and they realize, this is not what we thought coronavirus infection looks like. This is not the way it usually affects patients. And they know that by looking at Jack and figuring out what’s going on with him, they are going to learn a lot more about what this virus can do to kids.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jack mcmorrow I’m getting to the pain now. It was a throbbing, stinging rush of, like, you could feel it going through your veins.

pam belluck

So when Jack gets to the hospital, he is just exhausted and in so much pain.

jack mcmorrow You could feel — it was almost like someone injected you with straight up fire. Just fire.

pam belluck

The major symptom that’s going on with Jack is that he has very low blood pressure.

jack mcmorrow You’ve got to remember, my heart rate was at 165 while I was sleeping. That’s like a marathon runner.

pam belluck

And he has a very, very fast heart rate, because his heart is trying very hard to compensate for that low blood pressure that is preventing him from pumping oxygen and nutrients throughout his body to his critical organs. So that’s what they’ve got to treat. That is a condition that is called cardiogenic shock. It is heart failure. It is fatal if not treated. And he was telling me that he started to focus his energy. He started to feel like, I have got to understand what is going on with my body. I’ve got to know, because if I don’t know what I’m fighting, then I can’t fight it. So he starts to talk to the doctors.

jack mcmorrow They don’t get a lot of kids that can actually talk to them since it’s pediatrics.

pam belluck

And he’s a ninth-grade kid, and he’s been taking biology, and he has some understanding about the heart and the lungs and how they all work. And so he’s asking them lots of questions.

jack mcmorrow We were going back and forth with the whole — especially the way my heart related to my cardiovascular and circulatory system, never mind my —

pam belluck

And that made him feel much more in control, or at least it was a little bit less terrifying for him once he kind of realized what he could understand. But in that first day or two —

jack mcmorrow It was scary.

pam belluck

— he did feel like he wasn’t going to come out of it.

speaker It didn’t look like I was coming out of it the same, if at all.

michael barbaro

And how do the doctors try to treat Jack during this time?

pam belluck

So the first thing that they’re trying to do is give him blood pressure medication to try to get his blood pressure up, but it’s just not working. It’s been 48 hours. And they are so worried about his heart, which is not pumping enough oxygen to his body, that they think they’re going to need to put him on a ventilator.

michael barbaro

Wow.

john mcmorrow They were going to intubate him. And I said, you know, that was breaking my heart. doris stroman If they were to — john mcmorrow And so did they. They didn’t want it, because they know that they had to brace me on the realistic approach that only 20 percent come off.

pam belluck

So they say, well, you know, why don’t we try some steroids? Now, steroids are this widely used medication that works in a lot of different ways and works for some things, it doesn’t work for other things, and it’s really hard to know whether it’s going to help him or not. But within a few hours, he starts to stabilize. They decide they don’t need the ventilator, and —

jack mcmorrow They were bringing me Icees and ginger ale — john mcmorrow They were bringing him everything, lollipops — jack mcmorrow — and I hadn’t had water. john mcmorrow He hadn’t no water, nothing in his mouth for over 48 hours because they were — jack mcmorrow For 48 hours. john mcmorrow — preparing him to do the tube. jack mcmorrow My mouth was — I felt like I was dying. And then they were throwing Icees my way. They were like, here you go, kid. They gave me lollipops. They gave me ginger ales. I was, like, living the life.

pam belluck

So it seems like the steroids worked, but doctors actually don’t know that 100 percent. And John, Jack’s father, called the pediatrician, their longtime pediatrician, and said, what happened? I don’t know what happened. And —

john mcmorrow He laughed. And I said, why? Why? Why? How did this happen? What did he do? And he goes, I don’t know. I said, you know my family’s going to believe this was the power of prayer. And he goes, I’ll go with that, because we don’t know why. We don’t know.

pam belluck

My family is going to think that it’s a miracle. And the pediatrician says, well, that works for me because I don’t really know either.

michael barbaro

And Pam, beyond the steroids and whether or not those worked, what did the doctors understand about what was going on here?

pam belluck

Well, they’re kind of mystified. I mean, they’ve got this kid, and they know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesn’t have symptoms that kind of look like what they’ve come to expect from coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning they’ve had two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they don’t have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering. And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have what’s called an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had coronavirus infection. And they think, let’s just give these kids — these other kids that test and see. And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had coronavirus.

michael barbaro

Pam, at this point, what do the doctors think that this is exactly? Because all of these kids have had coronavirus, but most of them don’t still have it.

pam belluck

What they think is this may be a kind of second-stage effect of coronavirus that we didn’t know was possible, that we didn’t know was part of the way this virus worked. These kids didn’t get the lung problems, the breathing problems, that kind of assault on the lungs that is the primary way that coronavirus works. And so what the doctors think is that at the time of their infection, their immune system did a really good job of just swatting the infection away, of battling it away — that’s why they didn’t have any symptoms at the time. But that somehow in the course of that fight, their immune system got so revved up and so hyperactive that it generated this inflammatory response weeks later, and their bodies had this incredible overzealous reaction that went throughout their bodies and caused all sorts of havoc.

michael barbaro

So this is not coronavirus for kids. It’s some kind of later-down-the-line, affiliated set of horrible conditions that follows it.

pam belluck

Exactly.

michael barbaro

I mean, what seems particularly scary about this is that theoretically any kid who has had the coronavirus — and I have to imagine there are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these across the United States, people like Jack who probably showed no symptoms whatsoever from the original infection — it now seems possible that they could develop these really awful new secondary symptoms.

pam belluck

That’s exactly the risk here. That’s exactly the worry. We know that kids are just as likely to get infected as adults. They don’t have any protection from infection. A whole lot of them end up showing no symptoms. And we wanted to think that that meant that they really weren’t getting that sick. But now we have this thing that shows up weeks later, and we don’t have any idea who will end up with this inflammatory syndrome and when.

michael barbaro

I mean, what are the implications of that as we think about reopening schools, for example? I mean, one of the kind of saving graces, silver linings of this pandemic was that kids were supposed to be spared, and that understanding seems to have been the basis for plans to reopen schools. What does it mean that this second-stage set of symptoms is now starting to show up among children?

pam belluck

It definitely puts a serious complication in those plans. It’s something that governors, federal officials, they are already thinking about — they are going to have to think about. It’s not like you can test kids and say, OK, you’re negative, or you have antibodies, you’re going to be fine. Because you could have antibodies, and then you could end up with this. So it makes that issue much more tenuous and much more complicated, and I don’t think anybody has a good answer for that right now.

michael barbaro

And Pam, how is Jack doing at this point?

pam belluck

He’s doing OK. He’s home.

jack mcmorrow And I came home to take the best shower I’ve ever had in my entire life. Not even gassing it. It was like 30 minutes. doris stroman You can’t get him in, and then you can’t get him out. jack mcmorrow No, no, no. It was like — doris stroman You know. You have kids. jack mcmorrow It was like 30 minutes, this one. And it felt fine, and then I was like, I got to stop running around because I’m going to fall. I’m going to get lightheaded and pass out. But completely ignoring my own self advice, just ran into my room, put on my headphones, talked to my friends, and I said, I’m home! And they were all like, yeah! doris stroman Any time he runs around — jack mcmorrow And it was the best. doris stroman — and says I’m alive, I’m alive — jack mcmorrow No. doris stroman — we go, “I’m a real boy!” jack mcmorrow I’m a real boy. doris stroman I’m a real boy! jack mcmorrow No, no, no, because I said that. doris stroman From “Pinocchio.” jack mcmorrow No, because I was in the hospital, and I was like there are no strings on me because — john mcmorrow Because he did IVs —

pam belluck

He has some residual heart issues, but they think that his issues, because he’s so young and otherwise healthy, that he’ll probably emerge from this with no real issues. They are going to be following him. They’re going to be following these other kids, too, because this is still a mystery, and they don’t really know whether it’s going to have any long-term effects. And since his case, since his successful treatment, doctors have been using the same playbook on other kids with his issue. So they think that the steroids were what helped him, and they are giving other kids steroids a lot earlier when they come into the hospital. So far, apparently the results have been pretty encouraging. They are writing up Jack’s case, along with some of the other kids, in an article that’s going to be published in a medical journal. Jack was very excited to learn about that. And he said to me —

jack mcmorrow It’s been really good being back home, and I just want to do more with my life now, now that I have it back.

pam belluck

I really want to do something with my life, now that I have it back.

jack mcmorrow In any way that I can. pam belluck That is awesome. jack mcmorrow Yeah.

pam belluck

He said this while holding his Captain America shield. So I thought — [LAUGHTER]

michael barbaro

He is, after all, a 14-year-old.

pam belluck

He is, after all, a 14-year-old boy.

jack mcmorrow I literally sent my biology teacher an email, saying thank you for educating me. pam belluck Really? john mcmorrow Oh, that was the first thing he did. jack mcmorrow I can show you it if you want. john mcmorrow Yes. You should actually — pam belluck I would love to see it. john mcmorrow — show it. doris stroman No, no, not now. Not now. Let her have it so — pam belluck Yeah, why don’t you email it to me. doris stroman It’s long, so just let her read it when she gets a minute.

pam belluck

[READING JACK’S EMAIL] “OK, I’ll try to make this email quick, because I’m still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is the main reason I’m not at home recovering right now, but rather in a cardio-monitoring room. “As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my heart and my systems, I’m confident that I was able to keep up with the conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to keep fighting — or rather, to keep my vitals in check. “To summarize what I’m trying to say — and this is the honest truth — I would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most. Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system, I’m now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand the doctors and communicate to them. “I don’t want to drag this out, and I know I said that I’d try to make this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to know what I needed to know. I’m sorry for making this email so long, and I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously, I’m genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year. “I hope your family and yourself stay safe. Thank you.”

michael barbaro

That’s lovely.

pam belluck

Isn’t that amazing?

michael barbaro

Is he back in school remotely?

pam belluck

He is back. Jack is back in school remotely. He’s taking that biology class and he’s seeing his friends. And he is — he is being Jack.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Pam. We really appreciate it.

pam belluck

Thank you.

michael barbaro

Last week, health officials gave Jack’s condition a name: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. So far, it has been found in about 200 children in the U.S. and Europe, and has killed several of them. Because the condition was just identified, it’s unclear how many cases have remained unreported. We’ll be right back.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: From the earliest days of the coronavirus, health officials believed that it largely spared children and teenagers, but recently that belief has been challenged. My colleague Pam Belluck on the story of a 14-year-old boy whose case is being studied to better understand the impact of the virus on children. It’s Thursday, May 21. Pam, when does this understanding that we all seem to have about the coronavirus and how it spares children, when does that start to change?

pam belluck

In late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said we’re noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms of inflammation. We don’t really know what this is about. Some have tested positive for coronavirus. Some haven’t. And it was just kind of saying we think we’re seeing something. So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided, well, we don’t really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number of cases. We can’t even say for certain that it’s connected to coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch it. And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital in New York City. The person said we’ve got two cases of this syndrome that they’ve been talking about in the UK. If you want to talk to somebody, let us know. And that’s how I got to know Jack McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this visit.

pam belluck

It’s a very warm, kind of cozy apartment. There are all these “welcome home” banners and balloons for Jack. And the family, Jack and his father John and his mother Doris, they just immediately welcomed me and our photographer Gabriela in, and they all just start talking. I just know immediately I have to put on my tape recorder because there’s no way I’m going to capture all this writing things down.

john mcmorrow He sent him a letter. jack mcmorrow Yes. Can I explain something — john mcmorrow Oh, come on. I’m giving backdrop here. You can explain all you want. jack mcmorrow No. First of all, I wanted to talk about how the virus was behaving like a bacteria. john mcmorrow OK, you’re gonna, but I just want to say — jack mcmorrow That was way back when. john mcmorrow — Randall — jack mcmorrow This thing’s probably not picking up anything. doris stroman I hope you know she’s taping all of you because — john mcmorrow Yeah, we barter like this all day long. doris stroman I got a bell from school — jack mcmorrow Stop with the bell. doris stroman — because they bicker. And I have to do this — john mcmorrow And it’s a timeout bell. doris stroman — and tell them to both go to each corner. jack mcmorrow I’m sorry about all this chaotic — pam belluck It’s wonderful. It’s wonderful. [bell ringing] john mcmorrow And these cleaned arteries, they have to bring you right back. jack mcmorrow I was coherent at this time. john mcmorrow No, I know. But I know you’ve been jumping things, and I know when you’re excited. jack mcmorrow Me jumping things? pam belluck You’re doing great. You’re doing great. jack mcmorrow Dad, you went from day one to me in the new I.C.U. That’s like a — doris stroman Do I need to get my bell? jack mcmorrow — huge jump. Dude, if — speaker Oh my God.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this family. Who are they?

pam belluck

So Jack’s father is John McMorrow.

john mcmorrow I know it’s your story, son.

pam belluck

He is a truck driver. He works as a Teamster for the film industry. He was recently laid off because of the pandemic. And his mother, Jack’s mother, is Doris Stroman. She works at a lab school with five and six-year-old kids. She was wearing a mask that had The Rolling Stones tongue logo on it.

doris stroman — to figure out what was going on, starting with his pediatrician.

pam belluck

And Jack is 14. He’s a ninth grader. He goes to Catholic school in Queens.

jack mcmorrow Yeah, and I have a whole bunch of other prop replica stuff. pam belluck So you’re a Star Wars fan? jack mcmorrow I like Marvel a lot more than I do — pam belluck Oh, you’re more of a Marvel person. OK. jack mcmorrow This is the Infinity Gauntlet from “Avengers: Infinity War.” I really have to — doris stroman They don’t have time for that, Jack. jack mcmorrow This is why —

michael barbaro

And, Pam, what is the story that Jack and his parents tell you about this mysterious condition that he has?

pam belluck

So Jack was living the world of a New York City teenager in a pandemic.

doris stroman He never left the house. jack mcmorrow I haven’t left — john mcmorrow Since March 13, he’s been in the house. doris stroman You never left the house. His school — john mcmorrow In his room, not even in here. doris stroman His Catholic school was one of the first that were closed. pam belluck Oh wow. doris stroman Didn’t leave the house.

pam belluck

March 12 was his last day of school, and he was doing the online learning thing.

doris stroman The one time he left the house other than — was to help me with the laundry and didn’t want to touch anything. jack mcmorrow I took a shower after I came up from the laundry room. doris stroman Yeah, the kid just — jack mcmorrow I’m a germophobe.

pam belluck

They just kind of stayed in. He was playing video games. He was chatting with his friends and that kind of thing. That was Jack’s world.

[music]

Then in mid-April, Jack’s parents start to notice some unusual things.

john mcmorrow Three weeks ago, he came out to me with a rash on the backside of his hands. jack mcmorrow Yeah. john mcmorrow I thought it was — jack mcmorrow It was bad. john mcmorrow — from the antibacterial soap. You know, Purell. Maybe he’s doing it too much. He’s sensitive. jack mcmorrow Yeah, for like — we thought it was nothing more than eczema. john mcmorrow And then I think a day or two later he — jack mcmorrow No, it was like — john mcmorrow — your mother told you something about your eyes. She thought you were playing video games too much. jack mcmorrow Yeah, the eyes definitely, but I don’t know if that was —

pam belluck

They went on, and then the next week — and this was April 21 —

jack mcmorrow I had got a normal fever, like 101, 102.

pam belluck

— Jack gets a fever.

jack mcmorrow I woke up one day with — doris stroman Sore throat. jack mcmorrow — sore throat. That was the first inflammation symptom that we had, which was — doris stroman On his hands, on his feet — jack mcmorrow On my hands, on my feet — doris stroman — on his neck. jack mcmorrow — and on my neck. That was the first —

pam belluck

And then around Friday, April 24, things start to get more severe.

jack mcmorrow That ended up being a swollen lymph node that grew to about the size of a tennis ball that you could visibly see coming on the side of my neck. doris stroman That was alarming.

pam belluck

By the next day, Saturday morning, he wakes up and he’s got a 104.7 fever.

michael barbaro

That is a real fever.

pam belluck

That is a serious fever. They call their pediatrician at 7:30 in the morning, and she says, you guys, you got to get to an urgent care clinic, and they do. And there he gets a coronavirus test, but it’s going to be a couple days before he gets the results.

michael barbaro

So at this point they think it might perhaps be Covid-19.

pam belluck

It doesn’t look like Covid-19, but we’re living in a world of Covid-19, and so I think that they are just sort of saying, well, let’s just test him. We don’t really know what this is. They send him home. Things just keep getting worse and worse. And by Monday morning, Jack wakes up. He cannot move. He can’t move.

jack mcmorrow Because I wake up, and to even sit up, I screamed for them. And I had 105 almost.

pam belluck

And he’s lying on the couch.

jack mcmorrow I was sleeping with my socks on, and he kind of saw red. And he takes off my socks to reveal my entire feet, right here, had just rashes on the insides and bottom. doris stroman At that time — jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman — we thought that was the apex. jack mcmorrow And my hands. doris stroman But it wasn’t until days later. jack mcmorrow Yeah, they thought that was bad. My hands here on my palms, a little bit at the back, all rashes. So my skin — to even touch my skin and feel —

pam belluck

It’s terribly, terribly frightening. And he says to me, I was very emotional.

jack mcmorrow I’m using the word emotional to try and cover up the fact I was crying like a baby. It was so bad.

pam belluck

They happen to have a home blood pressure monitor, so they take his blood pressure. And this is where, as if all of these symptoms weren’t alarming enough and frightening enough, the blood pressure is very low. And so they know they had to take him to the hospital. They had to figure out how to get him out of the house. He can’t move. So John and Jack kind of demonstrate this for me.

jack mcmorrow I put my hands on his arms like this and, not kidding, shuffled my way. john mcmorrow And I had to then hold him up — jack mcmorrow With his arms.

pam belluck

John picks him up, puts Jack’s feet on top of John’s feet, and then walks backward out the apartment door, sort of shuffling Jack along.

doris stroman And when we got to the hospital — john mcmorrow They took a wheelchair. doris stroman — they took a wheelchair. jack mcmorrow Yeah, I took a wheelchair. doris stroman He couldn’t walk. john mcmorrow He couldn’t walk no more. He couldn’t bend his legs.

pam belluck

So he gets to the hospital. They are trying to figure out, again, what’s going on. They don’t know.

john mcmorrow — everything back and forth. You had a cardiologist department. You had the pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts, and then you had the immunology all throwing numbers and prescriptions and how they count through each other to deal with him. And this is stuff that I — it’s French to me. You might as well just tell me —

pam belluck

And while he’s there, they get the coronavirus test results back from the clinic that he went to on Saturday two days earlier.

michael barbaro

And what does it say?

pam belluck

They’re negative. So they’re crossing that off the list. They say, we really should probably send you home because we don’t really know what this is, and we think maybe you can just kind of watch it at home.

doris stroman Because they were riding the wave that he tested negative.

pam belluck

Well, Doris is not happy about that. She says —

doris stroman And I said, well, he needs to be tested again. And she said, we only test those who are admitted. And I said, well, then he needs to be admitted. We have nowhere to be —

pam belluck

So there’s a communication around that. And they agree there’s no harm in doing another coronavirus test. Why not? We don’t really know what’s happening. Why not? So they do another coronavirus test. And then while they’re there waiting, another symptom emerges.

doris stroman When he woke up, his eyes were like this. And I was just like, what just — jack mcmorrow Yeah, they were rolling in the back of my head. doris stroman And they were red.

pam belluck

His eyes turned bright red. As his mom is telling me about this, she is pointing to a red pillow on their couch, and she says, it’s like this. And his eyes are rolling back into his head, and they’re bright red.

doris stroman He was like, I’m fine, I’m fine, like this. I’m fine. I’m fine. john mcmorrow When was this?

pam belluck

Then the doctor comes in and tells them that, guess what? The new coronavirus test, the second one, it was positive.

michael barbaro

Pam, how could that be that he has a negative test and just a few days later, suddenly a positive test?

pam belluck

Well, unfortunately this is kind of the reality of coronavirus testing right now that they are not 100 percent reliable. It’s a little bit of a Wild West situation. So there are cases of false negatives, and that’s obviously what was the case with Jack. So once they realize that he is Covid positive, they decide at that hospital that he’s got to go to a children’s hospital. And Jack is not on board with this. He does not want to go. And the doctor says to him, “If I send you home today, you will be dead by tomorrow.”

jack mcmorrow That, I would say, had scared me to death. But it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight.

pam belluck

So Jack gets to the children’s hospital in the ambulance. And the doctors take one look, and they realize, this is not what we thought coronavirus infection looks like. This is not the way it usually affects patients. And they know that by looking at Jack and figuring out what’s going on with him, they are going to learn a lot more about what this virus can do to kids.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

jack mcmorrow I’m getting to the pain now. It was a throbbing, stinging rush of, like, you could feel it going through your veins.

pam belluck

So when Jack gets to the hospital, he is just exhausted and in so much pain.

jack mcmorrow You could feel — it was almost like someone injected you with straight up fire. Just fire.

pam belluck

The major symptom that’s going on with Jack is that he has very low blood pressure.

jack mcmorrow You’ve got to remember, my heart rate was at 165 while I was sleeping. That’s like a marathon runner.

pam belluck

And he has a very, very fast heart rate, because his heart is trying very hard to compensate for that low blood pressure that is preventing him from pumping oxygen and nutrients throughout his body to his critical organs. So that’s what they’ve got to treat. That is a condition that is called cardiogenic shock. It is heart failure. It is fatal if not treated. And he was telling me that he started to focus his energy. He started to feel like, I have got to understand what is going on with my body. I’ve got to know, because if I don’t know what I’m fighting, then I can’t fight it. So he starts to talk to the doctors.

jack mcmorrow They don’t get a lot of kids that can actually talk to them since it’s pediatrics.

pam belluck

And he’s a ninth-grade kid, and he’s been taking biology, and he has some understanding about the heart and the lungs and how they all work. And so he’s asking them lots of questions.

jack mcmorrow We were going back and forth with the whole — especially the way my heart related to my cardiovascular and circulatory system, never mind my —

pam belluck

And that made him feel much more in control, or at least it was a little bit less terrifying for him once he kind of realized what he could understand. But in that first day or two —

jack mcmorrow It was scary.

pam belluck

— he did feel like he wasn’t going to come out of it.

speaker It didn’t look like I was coming out of it the same, if at all.

michael barbaro

And how do the doctors try to treat Jack during this time?

pam belluck

So the first thing that they’re trying to do is give him blood pressure medication to try to get his blood pressure up, but it’s just not working. It’s been 48 hours. And they are so worried about his heart, which is not pumping enough oxygen to his body, that they think they’re going to need to put him on a ventilator.

michael barbaro

Wow.

john mcmorrow They were going to intubate him. And I said, you know, that was breaking my heart. doris stroman If they were to — john mcmorrow And so did they. They didn’t want it, because they know that they had to brace me on the realistic approach that only 20 percent come off.

pam belluck

So they say, well, you know, why don’t we try some steroids? Now, steroids are this widely used medication that works in a lot of different ways and works for some things, it doesn’t work for other things, and it’s really hard to know whether it’s going to help him or not. But within a few hours, he starts to stabilize. They decide they don’t need the ventilator, and —

jack mcmorrow They were bringing me Icees and ginger ale — john mcmorrow They were bringing him everything, lollipops — jack mcmorrow — and I hadn’t had water. john mcmorrow He hadn’t no water, nothing in his mouth for over 48 hours because they were — jack mcmorrow For 48 hours. john mcmorrow — preparing him to do the tube. jack mcmorrow My mouth was — I felt like I was dying. And then they were throwing Icees my way. They were like, here you go, kid. They gave me lollipops. They gave me ginger ales. I was, like, living the life.

pam belluck

So it seems like the steroids worked, but doctors actually don’t know that 100 percent. And John, Jack’s father, called the pediatrician, their longtime pediatrician, and said, what happened? I don’t know what happened. And —

john mcmorrow He laughed. And I said, why? Why? Why? How did this happen? What did he do? And he goes, I don’t know. I said, you know my family’s going to believe this was the power of prayer. And he goes, I’ll go with that, because we don’t know why. We don’t know.

pam belluck

My family is going to think that it’s a miracle. And the pediatrician says, well, that works for me because I don’t really know either.

michael barbaro

And Pam, beyond the steroids and whether or not those worked, what did the doctors understand about what was going on here?

pam belluck

Well, they’re kind of mystified. I mean, they’ve got this kid, and they know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesn’t have symptoms that kind of look like what they’ve come to expect from coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning they’ve had two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they don’t have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering. And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have what’s called an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had coronavirus infection. And they think, let’s just give these kids — these other kids that test and see. And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had coronavirus.

michael barbaro

Pam, at this point, what do the doctors think that this is exactly? Because all of these kids have had coronavirus, but most of them don’t still have it.

pam belluck

What they think is this may be a kind of second-stage effect of coronavirus that we didn’t know was possible, that we didn’t know was part of the way this virus worked. These kids didn’t get the lung problems, the breathing problems, that kind of assault on the lungs that is the primary way that coronavirus works. And so what the doctors think is that at the time of their infection, their immune system did a really good job of just swatting the infection away, of battling it away — that’s why they didn’t have any symptoms at the time. But that somehow in the course of that fight, their immune system got so revved up and so hyperactive that it generated this inflammatory response weeks later, and their bodies had this incredible overzealous reaction that went throughout their bodies and caused all sorts of havoc.

michael barbaro

So this is not coronavirus for kids. It’s some kind of later-down-the-line, affiliated set of horrible conditions that follows it.

pam belluck

Exactly.

michael barbaro

I mean, what seems particularly scary about this is that theoretically any kid who has had the coronavirus — and I have to imagine there are tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these across the United States, people like Jack who probably showed no symptoms whatsoever from the original infection — it now seems possible that they could develop these really awful new secondary symptoms.

pam belluck

That’s exactly the risk here. That’s exactly the worry. We know that kids are just as likely to get infected as adults. They don’t have any protection from infection. A whole lot of them end up showing no symptoms. And we wanted to think that that meant that they really weren’t getting that sick. But now we have this thing that shows up weeks later, and we don’t have any idea who will end up with this inflammatory syndrome and when.

michael barbaro

I mean, what are the implications of that as we think about reopening schools, for example? I mean, one of the kind of saving graces, silver linings of this pandemic was that kids were supposed to be spared, and that understanding seems to have been the basis for plans to reopen schools. What does it mean that this second-stage set of symptoms is now starting to show up among children?

pam belluck

It definitely puts a serious complication in those plans. It’s something that governors, federal officials, they are already thinking about — they are going to have to think about. It’s not like you can test kids and say, OK, you’re negative, or you have antibodies, you’re going to be fine. Because you could have antibodies, and then you could end up with this. So it makes that issue much more tenuous and much more complicated, and I don’t think anybody has a good answer for that right now.

michael barbaro

And Pam, how is Jack doing at this point?

pam belluck

He’s doing OK. He’s home.

jack mcmorrow And I came home to take the best shower I’ve ever had in my entire life. Not even gassing it. It was like 30 minutes. doris stroman You can’t get him in, and then you can’t get him out. jack mcmorrow No, no, no. It was like — doris stroman You know. You have kids. jack mcmorrow It was like 30 minutes, this one. And it felt fine, and then I was like, I got to stop running around because I’m going to fall. I’m going to get lightheaded and pass out. But completely ignoring my own self advice, just ran into my room, put on my headphones, talked to my friends, and I said, I’m home! And they were all like, yeah! doris stroman Any time he runs around — jack mcmorrow And it was the best. doris stroman — and says I’m alive, I’m alive — jack mcmorrow No. doris stroman — we go, “I’m a real boy!” jack mcmorrow I’m a real boy. doris stroman I’m a real boy! jack mcmorrow No, no, no, because I said that. doris stroman From “Pinocchio.” jack mcmorrow No, because I was in the hospital, and I was like there are no strings on me because — john mcmorrow Because he did IVs —

pam belluck

He has some residual heart issues, but they think that his issues, because he’s so young and otherwise healthy, that he’ll probably emerge from this with no real issues. They are going to be following him. They’re going to be following these other kids, too, because this is still a mystery, and they don’t really know whether it’s going to have any long-term effects. And since his case, since his successful treatment, doctors have been using the same playbook on other kids with his issue. So they think that the steroids were what helped him, and they are giving other kids steroids a lot earlier when they come into the hospital. So far, apparently the results have been pretty encouraging. They are writing up Jack’s case, along with some of the other kids, in an article that’s going to be published in a medical journal. Jack was very excited to learn about that. And he said to me —

jack mcmorrow It’s been really good being back home, and I just want to do more with my life now, now that I have it back.

pam belluck

I really want to do something with my life, now that I have it back.

jack mcmorrow In any way that I can. pam belluck That is awesome. jack mcmorrow Yeah.

pam belluck

He said this while holding his Captain America shield. So I thought — [LAUGHTER]

michael barbaro

He is, after all, a 14-year-old.

pam belluck

He is, after all, a 14-year-old boy.

jack mcmorrow I literally sent my biology teacher an email, saying thank you for educating me. pam belluck Really? john mcmorrow Oh, that was the first thing he did. jack mcmorrow I can show you it if you want. john mcmorrow Yes. You should actually — pam belluck I would love to see it. john mcmorrow — show it. doris stroman No, no, not now. Not now. Let her have it so — pam belluck Yeah, why don’t you email it to me. doris stroman It’s long, so just let her read it when she gets a minute.

pam belluck

[READING JACK’S EMAIL] “OK, I’ll try to make this email quick, because I’m still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is the main reason I’m not at home recovering right now, but rather in a cardio-monitoring room. “As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my heart and my systems, I’m confident that I was able to keep up with the conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to keep fighting — or rather, to keep my vitals in check. “To summarize what I’m trying to say — and this is the honest truth — I would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most. Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system, I’m now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand the doctors and communicate to them. “I don’t want to drag this out, and I know I said that I’d try to make this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to know what I needed to know. I’m sorry for making this email so long, and I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously, I’m genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year. “I hope your family and yourself stay safe. Thank you.”

michael barbaro

That’s lovely.

pam belluck

Isn’t that amazing?

michael barbaro

Is he back in school remotely?

pam belluck

He is back. Jack is back in school remotely. He’s taking that biology class and he’s seeing his friends. And he is — he is being Jack.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Pam. We really appreciate it.

pam belluck

Thank you.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the coronavirus is killing black Americans at staggeringly higher rates than white Americans. My colleague, Times Magazine writer Linda Villarosa, on the myth of the pandemic as the great equalizer. It’s Wednesday, May 20.

linda villarosa Hello? nicole charles Hello. Hello? linda villarosa Hello. Hi, my name’s Linda Villarosa. I’m from The New York Times Magazine. nicole charles How are you, Miss Linda? linda villarosa I’m OK. How are you? nicole charles I’m just OK, too. linda villarosa Yeah. I think we should just accept that we’re, like, OK. And listen, I’m — I’ve been hearing stories about your husband all morning and, you know, wish I had gotten to meet him. What a wonderful person he sounds like. nicole charles Oh, yes he was. That’s what he was.

michael barbaro

Linda, tell me about Cornell Charles.

linda villarosa

Cornell Charles, who goes by the nickname Dickey, was born and raised in New Orleans. He still lived in the house where he grew up. He was a family man who had two daughters. He was married for decades to Nicole Charles, his wife, who I got to speak to recently.

nicole charles My husband loved to cook. Every Sunday my husband would cook — you would think he was cooking for the military.

linda villarosa

Dickey was the king of the kitchen. Every Sunday after church, friends and family gathered at Nicole and Dickey’s house.

nicole charles You didn’t have to have an invite to come in. Everybody knew it — I want to eat something, I’m going by Cornell and Nicole’s.

linda villarosa

People knew you could just go there. The door was open.

nicole charles He loved for you to gloat over his food. He wanted you to brag on it. So he would literally sit there and watch you eat it, and he was always like, “OK, how it taste? How it taste?” And everybody would be like, “Look at the plate. What does that tell you?” You know, so — linda villarosa And what were his best dishes? nicole charles Oh, my god, Miss Linda. His gumbo was number one. He was definitely a seafood boiler.

linda villarosa

He cooked seafood. He cooked gumbo.

nicole charles He also was a master of spaghetti salad.

linda villarosa

He also made meatballs.

nicole charles He would cook meatballs the size of a baseball. So everybody would call them miniature meatloaves, because they were so big.

linda villarosa

And as a community man, he was also part of this club called the Zulu Club.

linda villarosa Tell me about what the Zulu group meant to your husband. nicole charles It was — let met see how I can — it was in his blood. If I can — that kind of sums it up.

michael barbaro

And what is the Zulu Club?

linda villarosa

So the Zulu Club is an organization of mostly black men in New Orleans.

nicole charles He first got involved in Zulu in around 2004. My dad was Zulu governor that year. And my husband began to deal with Zulu.

linda villarosa

And it was started in 1909. Black people were still reeling from the end of slavery. And also, it was during the years of Jim Crow, when black people and other people couldn’t afford funerals. And so the Zulu Club members came together to pool their money together to bury their dead in a dignified manner.

nicole charles He was passionate about it. And he would give his all. Zulu was definitely something he enjoyed. It was a respectable organization of men.

linda villarosa

Most of the year, it’s a civic club. So they collect food. There’s scholarships, a mentoring program. But during Mardi Gras —

linda villarosa

It’s the symbol of black New Orleans. And it involves festivals, and balls, and all kinds of different events.

[band music]

linda villarosa

The event that Dickey Charles was the most involved with was the Governor’s Ball. And there were thousands of people at that event. It’s a party. People bring their own food. You have to wear formal clothes or else you can’t get in. People are elbow to elbow. They’re dancing. And it lasts all night. It’s really fun. But as this was happening, behind the scenes coronavirus was also building.

[parade sounds]

linda villarosa

So.

nicole charles He came home from work.

linda villarosa

10 days after Mardi Gras ended, Dickey Charles didn’t feel well.

nicole charles Then he said, “I feel like I’m coming down with something.” Which is normal for him. I said, well, OK. You know, why don’t you just take it easy? But he spiked a fever, like the next day. And I’m just thinking, he got the flu. So let’s give you some Tylenol and then put some fluids in you and — whatever, whatever. So two or three days of that went on with his flu spiking. And my husband is a big man. Even if he was sick, he would still eat. But I couldn’t even get him to eat soup, and that was his go-to thing when he was sick. So I said, “Baby, you have to put something in your stomach,” because he was a diabetic. He also had high blood pressure, and he also had kidney disease. Saturday morning, we wake up. Still. I said, “Baby, how you feel?” And he was just like, “Ah, you know, I’m — I feel faint.” And I said, “OK, I don’t like that. I said, go take a shower, put on some clothes. We’re going to the E.R.” So that was March 14.

linda villarosa

They checked him in to the hospital, and by the following day, it was clear that something was wrong.

nicole charles Sunday, when the medical doctor came in, she said, I want you to see the chest X-rays. So I said OK. She put it up on the screen. She said, “Well, you see where his left lung is clear?” Left lung is fine. She said, “But you see this little cloud over his right lung?” I said, yes, ma’am. She said, well, this could be pneumonia. But she said, “But I’m going to start him on some antibiotics. In case that’s what it is, I want to beat it.” In a matter of hours — in a matter of hours, they come back, and they tell me how bad his lungs are.

linda villarosa

And that was a clue that they needed to test him for the coronavirus, even though it would take 10 days for the results to come back.

nicole charles And one of the doctors came in and said, “We need to have a very honest conversation. We need to vent your husband now.” So of course my heart dropped. And I said, “A ventilator?” And he was like, “Yes, ma’am. His lungs will not be functioning much longer on their own.” linda villarosa Goodness. nicole charles I was like, he really is — my husband really is sick, which I didn’t realize it was to that extent. If they’re telling me he needs to be on a ventilator. I don’t want to say no and not give him a chance. Do you know what I’m saying? linda villarosa Mm-hmm. nicole charles So I’m like, OK. All right, let’s do it.

linda villarosa

So for the next three days, Nicole was at the hospital. Dickey’s on the ventilator. He was in a coma-like state, so he’s not responding.

nicole charles So — linda villarosa What were you saying to him? nicole charles Oh, my god, how much I love him. I miss him. You know, pray. I need you to pray. You know, I was telling him, “You may not can speak, but God can hear your prayer.” And that was basically my conversation for him every day in I.C.U. You know, and we would listen to gospel music. I would pray for him anyway. And I was in the midst of praying for him — which is what I did all the time. I would touch him from his head to his toe, and I would pray over his body. I was at his feet, and I was coming back up towards his head, and he opened his eyes for me. And I said, “Oh,” I said, “Baby, you opened your eyes for me.” I said, “I’m so proud of you.” And he knew I was there, because he would nod. Now, at this time I was playing gospel music, and the phone went off. And I said, “Do you want me to play another gospel song for you?” And he nodded his head. “Do you love me?” And he nodded his head. And I said, “I love you so much.” I said, “I’m so proud of you. You opened your eyes.” And he had his eyes open the whole time I was there. And the nurse who was working with him that day, she said, “Mr. Charles, I’ve been trying to get you to open your eyes all day, and you’re showing off for your wife.” And I said, “That’s right, because he had to look at his wife. He heard my voice, and he had to see my face.” And that was the last time I saw my husband with his eyes open. He looked good. My husband never lost weight. He never looked sick, Miss Linda. He never — even when he was on the ventilator, he never looked sick. He never looked sick. And I thank God for that. Because him looking sick and being sick probably would have really screwed me up. Looking at him looking healthy, and — and I — you know, I told him. I said, “I love you, and I’m leaving you in God’s hands.” I kept talking to him and just — telling him how much we loved him. And how much we’re going to miss him. And he took his last breath in front of me at 1:33 on the 24th. He looked really, really peaceful. He did. Yes.

linda villarosa

He died that afternoon. And he was only 51 years old.

[music]

linda villarosa

The next day, as Nicole was grieving, she finally got the results of Dickey’s Covid test and found out that, yes, he was positive. He did die of the coronavirus.

nicole charles The phone calls that I have gotten from Zulu members have been overwhelming. They have reached out via text, via phone call, sending cards. It’s just so much, you know Miss Linda, and I didn’t realize the magnitude of the people my husband touched until his passing. And I’ve gotten so many phone calls to tell me, you know, he motivated me to do this, or he encouraged me to do that, or he was my mentor. I mean, I can just stand so proud and say he was my husband. I can stand tall and just brag that that was my husband, you know what I mean? It’s so funny, because being his wife, and as much as he used to go — and when I say “go,” he went with a purpose. Baby, I’m going to — I’ve got to go practice this team at this time. I have to practice this team at that time. When I leave there, I have to go to this meeting, or whatever, whatever. And to realize what his purpose was now gives me such a sense of joy. archived recording Well, Since Mardi Gras Day, it has been a devastating couple of weeks for Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.

linda villarosa

But he wasn’t the only member of the Zulu Club to get sick.

archived recording Several of their members tested positive for coronavirus.

linda villarosa

At the time I finished my reporting, 30 members of the Zulu Club had been infected with the virus, and of those 30, eight had died.

michael barbaro

Wow.

linda villarosa

I looked at the Facebook page yesterday and saw that on May 4 another one of them died.

michael barbaro

Linda, what did you, and what did the members of the Zulu Club, make of the number of members who were dying?

linda villarosa

At first, it felt like, oh, wrong place, wrong time situation. Mardi Gras was really crowded. Carnival season lasted for six weeks. And there were crowds. People were elbow to elbow. So it made sense at the beginning. But, frankly, behind the scenes, those of us who understand public health or who look at questions of public health started to worry, because we knew that there were going to be high death rates among black people and high hospitalization rates. But there was no data yet. So when the data started rolling out —

archived recording Nationwide, cities have been releasing Covid-19 data showing racial disparities in diagnosis and in death.

linda villarosa

It confirmed what many in public health knew.

archived recording Those numbers show a disturbing trend.

linda villarosa

But it was still very scary.

archived recording Black people are dying at a much higher rate than any other race right now.

linda villarosa

In the state of Louisiana —

archived recording Of the more than 500 people whose final breaths were stolen by this disease, the state says that more than two thirds of them were black.

linda villarosa

Black people comprise 30 percent of the population but 70 percent of those who have died of Covid. Then other states started to roll out their data.

archived recording A thousand more cases of Covid-19 confirmed here in Illinois just today.

linda villarosa

In Illinois —

archived recording 1 More than half of all cases in Chicago are in the African-American community. archived recording 2 38 percent of Missourians who died from Covid-19 were black, but African-Americans only make up 12 percent of Missouri’s population. archived recording 3 The reports are startling — in North Carolina, Connecticut, and Michigan, too.

linda villarosa

So at that point, it begged the question why. Why was this killing so many black people? Why was it having such a devastating effect on black America?

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Linda, how do we explain this extraordinarily higher death rate in the black community from the coronavirus?

linda villarosa

Well, it was interesting. During the beginning of this pandemic —

archived recording (andrew cuomo) Everyone — everyone — is subject to this virus. It is the great equalizer.

linda villarosa

People started saying, oh, Covid is the great equalizer, or, the virus doesn’t discriminate.

archived recording From the moment the coronavirus outbreak began, health officials have preached that Covid-19 doesn’t discriminate, that it’s an equal opportunity killer.

linda villarosa

But those of us who have studied public health know that that wasn’t true. And in fact, we say it a different way. We say, when America sneezes the black community gets pneumonia. And for me, I’m really passionate about racial health disparities. I’ve been studying it for 30 years. I was a young editor at Essence magazine, and I started first writing about this. I’m writing a book about it now. And we have long known that all kinds of diseases do discriminate. It’s not equal.

michael barbaro

And how does Covid-19 discriminate against black America?

linda villarosa

Covid-19 is more serious in black Americans. So we’re more likely to be hospitalized, to have a serious case, and to also die from it. And there are three main reasons for this disparity.

michael barbaro

OK. And what is the first of those reasons?

linda villarosa

The first reason is simple. It’s proximity to the virus. Black Americans are more likely to be employed in essential jobs, in frontline jobs, in jobs where they are more commonly exposed to the virus itself. I’m thinking of Dickey Charles. He continued working. He was a courier for a medical company. I think of the Zulu members. One of the men who died was a postal worker. He was a mail carrier. One was a police officer who contracted Covid. Another was a security guard. And look, we don’t know whether these members of the Zulu Club contracted the virus at Mardi Gras or on their jobs. But we do know that the majority of black people in this country have jobs that put them at risk. So that’s the first reason black Americans are dying at such disproportionate rates. The second factor is discrimination that is embedded in the health care system itself.

michael barbaro

Linda, this is something you and I first talked about over a year ago when we did an episode of “The Daily” about black women and their mortality rates when giving birth. And you explained this concept that, essentially, racism — conscious or deeply unconscious — influences the kind of medical care delivered to black patients.

linda villarosa

Yes. And I believe that it’s unconscious. And it’s not just white doctors, it’s also black doctors we — or doctors of other races. Because we all live in this society that has discrimination and racist images embedded in our culture. It’s baked in. Thousands of studies have shown over decades that black people get unequal treatment in our health care system.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can walk me through a scenario that people in public health say could or has happened when it comes to this pandemic that explains this.

linda villarosa

Well, you can imagine being a health care provider, specifically being a physician, and you’re having to make life-or-death decisions — who should get tested? Who should be admitted to the hospital? Who needs to be put on a ventilator? Who needs to be taken off a ventilator? So you’re a doctor, and people that don’t look like you, don’t have the same culture as you, don’t have the same background with you come in, you may think about them differently. Medical providers don’t go into medicine to harm people, but that harm may show up, especially during a very stressed out moment, which is the essence of this moment and coronavirus.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, what is the third major factor here in why something like the coronavirus discriminates against black Americans?

linda villarosa

So the third reason is that black Americans have more of the underlying conditions that make Covid-19 worse. Some of these are hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and asthma. So if you have these underlying conditions, you’re more likely to be quite sick. That was the case with Dickey Charles. He had high blood pressure. He had diabetes. He had kidney disease. And that is also the case with so many other black Americans.

michael barbaro

And why is that? Why is there such a disproportionate level of these pre-existing underlying conditions?

linda villarosa

So at first glance, it seems like, well, if everyone just takes better care of themselves, you can avoid these kinds of conditions.

michael barbaro

Right.

linda villarosa

But that tilts toward a kind of irresponsibility among black people that really isn’t fair. So a study in early April found out that people who have been subjected to long term exposure to air pollution are more likely to have serious cases of Covid than people who don’t. And black people are more likely to live in areas that are polluted. New Orleans is part of “cancer alley,” which is an 85-mile stretch along the highway in Louisiana where there’s the largest concentration of petrochemical factories in the country. And so New Orleans itself is the victim of this kind of inequal exposure to dirty air, dirty water, dirty soil. And this is where the Zulus live. This is where Dickey Charles and Nicole Charles live. So the environment is one factor that drives the underlying conditions that black Americans are disproportionately more likely to face. But a second factor is the concept of weathering.

michael barbaro

And weathering is the concept that racism takes a physical toll on the black body and leaves it more vulnerable to all kinds of illness.

linda villarosa

That’s exactly right. And it’s best to think of it as a kind of accelerated aging. So adversity comes in the form of discrimination. It could be discrimination in housing. It could be discrimination by police. It could be discrimination in employment. It could just be the stress of having to struggle every day. It changes the systems of the body at a cellular level. So if you are faced with a kind of adverse event, your blood pressure goes up, your heart rate goes up, your breathing becomes more rapid. And this is all part of the fight-or-flight syndrome. But it shouldn’t be made to happen over and over and over again. But if you’re facing that kind of adversity, that’s what happens, and it wears away the body. It ages the body. So that would make sense why black people are more likely to have these kind of underlying conditions and why we get them at younger ages.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, putting all of this together, all these factors, you have a black population at a higher risk of exposure, just given the nature of their work; a population that already has higher rates of underlying conditions; on top of that, there is this weathering phenomenon that deepens those conditions, literally seems to age this already-not-well, vulnerable body; and finally, a medical system inclined to undertreat these people when they come in to a hospital or a doctor’s office.

linda villarosa

Yes. And that is what has created this perfect and terrible storm when it comes to the coronavirus and black people in America.

michael barbaro

Linda, it sounds like the public health experts you talked to, that they knew these death rates, these infection rates, this kind of disproportionateness, was going to play out with this pandemic. And now that it has, how are they thinking about it?

linda villarosa

I think this is a difficult moment, but it’s also a moment where a tragedy can be turned into something else. So those in public health have known that there are racial disparities in health. I mean, we’ve known since 1899 when W.E.B. Du Bois was calling it a crisis. And some of the people that I interviewed in my story have been studying this for decades and have added up the price. And so they’re hoping that now is a moment of reckoning to say, this is a horrible moment, please don’t turn away. Do something about this.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what the government’s response to this pandemic, which is widely acknowledged, was slow, what that has meant for this particular group of Americans.

linda villarosa

So the government’s slow and uncoordinated and confusing response hurt everyone. It hurt all Americans. It harmed us. But it hurt this group — black people, black Americans — worse. Because we were already more vulnerable to many of these health problems that make Covid-19 worse. And sometimes when I think of it, I think specifically about the men in the Zulu Club and how they were harmed by this federal response. And it had this terrible sad trickle-down effect to them on the ground.

michael barbaro

Right. Well, how are members of the Zulu Club and their families doing at this point?

linda villarosa

The entire group is reeling from what happened. I mean, they’re a brotherhood, so they’re trying to support and take care of each other. But they’re in pain.

linda villarosa And you’re good? You’re feeling OK?

linda villarosa

I also checked in with Nicole, Dickey Charles’s wife, just to see how she was doing.

nicole charles I’m feeling as good as I can be. God didn’t choose me, so I have to find a way to maneuver my new life.

linda villarosa

This is a very hard time for her. She’s grieving this man that she was married to for three decades.

nicole charles But it’s going to be a huge, huge adjustment. I tell people my life did a 180-degree turn within a matter of 10 days, you know. linda villarosa Yeah. nicole charles And I sorely miss my husband. Out of 30 years, Miss Linda, I’ve never not slept next to him for longer than two days. In 30 years. linda villarosa Oh, wow. nicole charles If I did not sleep next to him, he was going to a football camp —

[music]

linda villarosa

More than a week after Dickey Charles died, she arranged his funeral. It was at their church. There were 10 people there — 10 family members and an organist.

archived recording (SINGING) I feel trust in the Lord. I feel —

linda villarosa

It was also live streamed. Six hundred people tuned in. I tuned in.

archived recording (SINGING) Oh, I feel trust in the Lord.

linda villarosa

I found it sad and hard, because I was thinking about someone like Dickey and many of the other Zulus would have gotten a different kind of sendoff. Would have gotten a second line funeral, where, you know, it happens in the street, and all those 600 people would be right there in person. People would be dressed up. There would be music. And that is the legacy of the Zulu Club. It was formed to help people send off their dead in a graceful, in a respectful, in a dignified way, and in a way that celebrated their life.

[music]

michael barbaro

Linda, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

linda villarosa

Thank you. And please take care of yourself.

michael barbaro

You, too.

linda villarosa Well, thank you so much. nicole charles Thank you for taking out the time and — linda villarosa Take care of yourself. nicole charles I will. I will. I will. Thank you so much. OK. linda villarosa Thank you. Bye-bye. nicole charles OK. Bye-bye.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the coronavirus is killing black Americans at staggeringly higher rates than white Americans. My colleague, Times Magazine writer Linda Villarosa, on the myth of the pandemic as the great equalizer. It’s Wednesday, May 20.

What a wonderful person he sounds like. nicole charles Oh, yes he was. That’s what he was.

michael barbaro

Linda, tell me about Cornell Charles.

linda villarosa

Cornell Charles, who goes by the nickname Dickey, was born and raised in New Orleans. He still lived in the house where he grew up. He was a family man who had two daughters. He was married for decades to Nicole Charles, his wife, who I got to speak to recently.

nicole charles My husband loved to cook. Every Sunday my husband would cook — you would think he was cooking for the military.

linda villarosa

Dickey was the king of the kitchen. Every Sunday after church, friends and family gathered at Nicole and Dickey’s house.

He also made meatballs.

nicole charles He would cook meatballs the size of a baseball. So everybody would call them miniature meatloaves, because they were so big.

michael barbaro

And what is the Zulu Club?

So the Zulu Club is an organization of mostly black men in New Orleans.

nicole charles He first got involved in Zulu in around 2004. My dad was Zulu governor that year. And my husband began to deal with Zulu.

linda villarosa

And it was started in 1909. Black people were still reeling from the end of slavery. And also, it was during the years of Jim Crow, when black people and other people couldn’t afford funerals. And so the Zulu Club members came together to pool their money together to bury their dead in a dignified manner.

nicole charles He was passionate about it. And he would give his all. Zulu was definitely something he enjoyed. It was a respectable organization of men.

linda villarosa

Most of the year, it’s a civic club. So they collect food. There’s scholarships, a mentoring program. But during Mardi Gras —

linda villarosa

It’s the symbol of black New Orleans. And it involves festivals, and balls, and all kinds of different events.

[band music]

linda villarosa

The event that Dickey Charles was the most involved with was the Governor’s Ball. And there were thousands of people at that event. It’s a party. People bring their own food. You have to wear formal clothes or else you can’t get in. People are elbow to elbow. They’re dancing. And it lasts all night. It’s really fun. But as this was happening, behind the scenes coronavirus was also building.

[parade sounds]

linda villarosa

So.

nicole charles He came home from work.

linda villarosa

10 days after Mardi Gras ended, Dickey Charles didn’t feel well.

nicole charles Then he said, “I feel like I’m coming down with something.” Which is normal for him. I said, well, OK. You know, why don’t you just take it easy? But he spiked a fever, like the next day. And I’m just thinking, he got the flu. So let’s give you some Tylenol and then put some fluids in you and — whatever, whatever. So two or three days of that went on with his flu spiking. And my husband is a big man. Even if he was sick, he would still eat. But I couldn’t even get him to eat soup, and that was his go-to thing when he was sick. So I said, “Baby, you have to put something in your stomach,” because he was a diabetic. He also had high blood pressure, and he also had kidney disease. Saturday morning, we wake up. Still. I said, “Baby, how you feel?” And he was just like, “Ah, you know, I’m — I feel faint.” And I said, “OK, I don’t like that. I said, go take a shower, put on some clothes. We’re going to the E.R.” So that was March 14.

linda villarosa

They checked him in to the hospital, and by the following day, it was clear that something was wrong.

nicole charles Sunday, when the medical doctor came in, she said, I want you to see the chest X-rays. So I said OK. She put it up on the screen. She said, “Well, you see where his left lung is clear?” Left lung is fine. She said, “But you see this little cloud over his right lung?” I said, yes, ma’am. She said, well, this could be pneumonia. But she said, “But I’m going to start him on some antibiotics. In case that’s what it is, I want to beat it.” In a matter of hours — in a matter of hours, they come back, and they tell me how bad his lungs are.

linda villarosa

And that was a clue that they needed to test him for the coronavirus, even though it would take 10 days for the results to come back.

nicole charles And one of the doctors came in and said, “We need to have a very honest conversation. We need to vent your husband now.” So of course my heart dropped. And I said, “A ventilator?” And he was like, “Yes, ma’am. His lungs will not be functioning much longer on their own.” linda villarosa Goodness. nicole charles I was like, he really is — my husband really is sick, which I didn’t realize it was to that extent. If they’re telling me he needs to be on a ventilator. I don’t want to say no and not give him a chance. Do you know what I’m saying? linda villarosa Mm-hmm. nicole charles So I’m like, OK. All right, let’s do it.

linda villarosa

So for the next three days, Nicole was at the hospital. Dickey’s on the ventilator. He was in a coma-like state, so he’s not responding.

nicole charles So — linda villarosa What were you saying to him? nicole charles Oh, my god, how much I love him. I miss him. You know, pray. I need you to pray. You know, I was telling him, “You may not can speak, but God can hear your prayer.” And that was basically my conversation for him every day in I.C.U. You know, and we would listen to gospel music. I would pray for him anyway. And I was in the midst of praying for him — which is what I did all the time. I would touch him from his head to his toe, and I would pray over his body. I was at his feet, and I was coming back up towards his head, and he opened his eyes for me. And I said, “Oh,” I said, “Baby, you opened your eyes for me.” I said, “I’m so proud of you.” And he knew I was there, because he would nod. Now, at this time I was playing gospel music, and the phone went off. And I said, “Do you want me to play another gospel song for you?” And he nodded his head. “Do you love me?” And he nodded his head. And I said, “I love you so much.” I said, “I’m so proud of you. You opened your eyes.” And he had his eyes open the whole time I was there. And the nurse who was working with him that day, she said, “Mr. Charles, I’ve been trying to get you to open your eyes all day, and you’re showing off for your wife.” And I said, “That’s right, because he had to look at his wife. He heard my voice, and he had to see my face.” And that was the last time I saw my husband with his eyes open. He looked good. My husband never lost weight. He never looked sick, Miss Linda. He never — even when he was on the ventilator, he never looked sick. He never looked sick. And I thank God for that. Because him looking sick and being sick probably would have really screwed me up. Looking at him looking healthy, and — and I — you know, I told him. I said, “I love you, and I’m leaving you in God’s hands.” I kept talking to him and just — telling him how much we loved him. And how much we’re going to miss him. And he took his last breath in front of me at 1:33 on the 24th. He looked really, really peaceful. He did. Yes.

linda villarosa

He died that afternoon. And he was only 51 years old.

[music]

linda villarosa

The next day, as Nicole was grieving, she finally got the results of Dickey’s Covid test and found out that, yes, he was positive. He did die of the coronavirus.

nicole charles The phone calls that I have gotten from Zulu members have been overwhelming. They have reached out via text, via phone call, sending cards. It’s just so much, you know Miss Linda, and I didn’t realize the magnitude of the people my husband touched until his passing. And I’ve gotten so many phone calls to tell me, you know, he motivated me to do this, or he encouraged me to do that, or he was my mentor. I mean, I can just stand so proud and say he was my husband. I can stand tall and just brag that that was my husband, you know what I mean? It’s so funny, because being his wife, and as much as he used to go — and when I say “go,” he went with a purpose. Baby, I’m going to — I’ve got to go practice this team at this time. I have to practice this team at that time. When I leave there, I have to go to this meeting, or whatever, whatever. And to realize what his purpose was now gives me such a sense of joy. archived recording Well, Since Mardi Gras Day, it has been a devastating couple of weeks for Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.

linda villarosa

But he wasn’t the only member of the Zulu Club to get sick.

archived recording Several of their members tested positive for coronavirus.

linda villarosa

At the time I finished my reporting, 30 members of the Zulu Club had been infected with the virus, and of those 30, eight had died.

michael barbaro

Wow.

linda villarosa

I looked at the Facebook page yesterday and saw that on May 4 another one of them died.

michael barbaro

Linda, what did you, and what did the members of the Zulu Club, make of the number of members who were dying?

linda villarosa

At first, it felt like, oh, wrong place, wrong time situation. Mardi Gras was really crowded. Carnival season lasted for six weeks. And there were crowds. People were elbow to elbow. So it made sense at the beginning. But, frankly, behind the scenes, those of us who understand public health or who look at questions of public health started to worry, because we knew that there were going to be high death rates among black people and high hospitalization rates. But there was no data yet. So when the data started rolling out —

archived recording Nationwide, cities have been releasing Covid-19 data showing racial disparities in diagnosis and in death.

linda villarosa

It confirmed what many in public health knew.

archived recording Those numbers show a disturbing trend.

linda villarosa

But it was still very scary.

archived recording Black people are dying at a much higher rate than any other race right now.

linda villarosa

In the state of Louisiana —

archived recording Of the more than 500 people whose final breaths were stolen by this disease, the state says that more than two thirds of them were black.

linda villarosa

Black people comprise 30 percent of the population but 70 percent of those who have died of Covid. Then other states started to roll out their data.

archived recording A thousand more cases of Covid-19 confirmed here in Illinois just today.

linda villarosa

In Illinois —

archived recording 1 More than half of all cases in Chicago are in the African-American community. archived recording 2 38 percent of Missourians who died from Covid-19 were black, but African-Americans only make up 12 percent of Missouri’s population. archived recording 3 The reports are startling — in North Carolina, Connecticut, and Michigan, too.

linda villarosa

So at that point, it begged the question why. Why was this killing so many black people? Why was it having such a devastating effect on black America?

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

Linda, how do we explain this extraordinarily higher death rate in the black community from the coronavirus?

linda villarosa

Well, it was interesting. During the beginning of this pandemic —

archived recording (andrew cuomo) Everyone — everyone — is subject to this virus. It is the great equalizer.

linda villarosa

People started saying, oh, Covid is the great equalizer, or, the virus doesn’t discriminate.

archived recording From the moment the coronavirus outbreak began, health officials have preached that Covid-19 doesn’t discriminate, that it’s an equal opportunity killer.

linda villarosa

But those of us who have studied public health know that that wasn’t true. And in fact, we say it a different way. We say, when America sneezes the black community gets pneumonia. And for me, I’m really passionate about racial health disparities. I’ve been studying it for 30 years. I was a young editor at Essence magazine, and I started first writing about this. I’m writing a book about it now. And we have long known that all kinds of diseases do discriminate. It’s not equal.

michael barbaro

And how does Covid-19 discriminate against black America?

linda villarosa

Covid-19 is more serious in black Americans. So we’re more likely to be hospitalized, to have a serious case, and to also die from it. And there are three main reasons for this disparity.

michael barbaro

OK. And what is the first of those reasons?

linda villarosa

The first reason is simple. It’s proximity to the virus. Black Americans are more likely to be employed in essential jobs, in frontline jobs, in jobs where they are more commonly exposed to the virus itself. I’m thinking of Dickey Charles. He continued working. He was a courier for a medical company. I think of the Zulu members. One of the men who died was a postal worker. He was a mail carrier. One was a police officer who contracted Covid. Another was a security guard. And look, we don’t know whether these members of the Zulu Club contracted the virus at Mardi Gras or on their jobs. But we do know that the majority of black people in this country have jobs that put them at risk. So that’s the first reason black Americans are dying at such disproportionate rates. The second factor is discrimination that is embedded in the health care system itself.

michael barbaro

Linda, this is something you and I first talked about over a year ago when we did an episode of “The Daily” about black women and their mortality rates when giving birth. And you explained this concept that, essentially, racism — conscious or deeply unconscious — influences the kind of medical care delivered to black patients.

linda villarosa

Yes. And I believe that it’s unconscious. And it’s not just white doctors, it’s also black doctors we — or doctors of other races. Because we all live in this society that has discrimination and racist images embedded in our culture. It’s baked in. Thousands of studies have shown over decades that black people get unequal treatment in our health care system.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can walk me through a scenario that people in public health say could or has happened when it comes to this pandemic that explains this.

linda villarosa

Well, you can imagine being a health care provider, specifically being a physician, and you’re having to make life-or-death decisions — who should get tested? Who should be admitted to the hospital? Who needs to be put on a ventilator? Who needs to be taken off a ventilator? So you’re a doctor, and people that don’t look like you, don’t have the same culture as you, don’t have the same background with you come in, you may think about them differently. Medical providers don’t go into medicine to harm people, but that harm may show up, especially during a very stressed out moment, which is the essence of this moment and coronavirus.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, what is the third major factor here in why something like the coronavirus discriminates against black Americans?

linda villarosa

So the third reason is that black Americans have more of the underlying conditions that make Covid-19 worse. Some of these are hypertension and heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and asthma. So if you have these underlying conditions, you’re more likely to be quite sick. That was the case with Dickey Charles. He had high blood pressure. He had diabetes. He had kidney disease. And that is also the case with so many other black Americans.

michael barbaro

And why is that? Why is there such a disproportionate level of these pre-existing underlying conditions?

linda villarosa

So at first glance, it seems like, well, if everyone just takes better care of themselves, you can avoid these kinds of conditions.

michael barbaro

Right.

linda villarosa

But that tilts toward a kind of irresponsibility among black people that really isn’t fair. So a study in early April found out that people who have been subjected to long term exposure to air pollution are more likely to have serious cases of Covid than people who don’t. And black people are more likely to live in areas that are polluted. New Orleans is part of “cancer alley,” which is an 85-mile stretch along the highway in Louisiana where there’s the largest concentration of petrochemical factories in the country. And so New Orleans itself is the victim of this kind of inequal exposure to dirty air, dirty water, dirty soil. And this is where the Zulus live. This is where Dickey Charles and Nicole Charles live. So the environment is one factor that drives the underlying conditions that black Americans are disproportionately more likely to face. But a second factor is the concept of weathering.

michael barbaro

And weathering is the concept that racism takes a physical toll on the black body and leaves it more vulnerable to all kinds of illness.

linda villarosa

That’s exactly right. And it’s best to think of it as a kind of accelerated aging. So adversity comes in the form of discrimination. It could be discrimination in housing. It could be discrimination by police. It could be discrimination in employment. It could just be the stress of having to struggle every day. It changes the systems of the body at a cellular level. So if you are faced with a kind of adverse event, your blood pressure goes up, your heart rate goes up, your breathing becomes more rapid. And this is all part of the fight-or-flight syndrome. But it shouldn’t be made to happen over and over and over again. But if you’re facing that kind of adversity, that’s what happens, and it wears away the body. It ages the body. So that would make sense why black people are more likely to have these kind of underlying conditions and why we get them at younger ages.

michael barbaro

So, Linda, putting all of this together, all these factors, you have a black population at a higher risk of exposure, just given the nature of their work; a population that already has higher rates of underlying conditions; on top of that, there is this weathering phenomenon that deepens those conditions, literally seems to age this already-not-well, vulnerable body; and finally, a medical system inclined to undertreat these people when they come in to a hospital or a doctor’s office.

linda villarosa

Yes. And that is what has created this perfect and terrible storm when it comes to the coronavirus and black people in America.

michael barbaro

Linda, it sounds like the public health experts you talked to, that they knew these death rates, these infection rates, this kind of disproportionateness, was going to play out with this pandemic. And now that it has, how are they thinking about it?

linda villarosa

I think this is a difficult moment, but it’s also a moment where a tragedy can be turned into something else. So those in public health have known that there are racial disparities in health. I mean, we’ve known since 1899 when W.E.B. Du Bois was calling it a crisis. And some of the people that I interviewed in my story have been studying this for decades and have added up the price. And so they’re hoping that now is a moment of reckoning to say, this is a horrible moment, please don’t turn away. Do something about this.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what the government’s response to this pandemic, which is widely acknowledged, was slow, what that has meant for this particular group of Americans.

linda villarosa

So the government’s slow and uncoordinated and confusing response hurt everyone. It hurt all Americans. It harmed us. But it hurt this group — black people, black Americans — worse. Because we were already more vulnerable to many of these health problems that make Covid-19 worse. And sometimes when I think of it, I think specifically about the men in the Zulu Club and how they were harmed by this federal response. And it had this terrible sad trickle-down effect to them on the ground.

michael barbaro

Right. Well, how are members of the Zulu Club and their families doing at this point?

linda villarosa

The entire group is reeling from what happened. I mean, they’re a brotherhood, so they’re trying to support and take care of each other. But they’re in pain.

linda villarosa And you’re good? You’re feeling OK?

linda villarosa

I also checked in with Nicole, Dickey Charles’s wife, just to see how she was doing.

nicole charles I’m feeling as good as I can be. God didn’t choose me, so I have to find a way to maneuver my new life.

linda villarosa

This is a very hard time for her. She’s grieving this man that she was married to for three decades.

nicole charles But it’s going to be a huge, huge adjustment. I tell people my life did a 180-degree turn within a matter of 10 days, you know. linda villarosa Yeah. nicole charles And I sorely miss my husband. Out of 30 years, Miss Linda, I’ve never not slept next to him for longer than two days. In 30 years. linda villarosa Oh, wow. nicole charles If I did not sleep next to him, he was going to a football camp —

[music]

linda villarosa

More than a week after Dickey Charles died, she arranged his funeral. It was at their church. There were 10 people there — 10 family members and an organist.

archived recording (SINGING) I feel trust in the Lord. I feel —

linda villarosa

It was also live streamed. Six hundred people tuned in. I tuned in.

archived recording (SINGING) Oh, I feel trust in the Lord.

linda villarosa

I found it sad and hard, because I was thinking about someone like Dickey and many of the other Zulus would have gotten a different kind of sendoff. Would have gotten a second line funeral, where, you know, it happens in the street, and all those 600 people would be right there in person. People would be dressed up. There would be music. And that is the legacy of the Zulu Club. It was formed to help people send off their dead in a graceful, in a respectful, in a dignified way, and in a way that celebrated their life.

Linda, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

Thank you. And please take care of yourself.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has fired the inspector general for the Department of State, whose investigation posed a threat to his administration. Maggie Haberman on the pattern that that reveals. It’s Tuesday, May 19. Maggie, where does the idea of an inspector general come from?

maggie haberman

So the idea of inspectors general, who are basically public watchdogs, emerged out of the Watergate era.

archived recording (richard nixon) I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.

maggie haberman

Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace after abusing his office.

archived recording (richard nixon) As president, I must put the interests of America first.

maggie haberman

Faith in government dipped substantially among the public.

archived recording (richard nixon) By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing, which is so desperately needed in America.

[music]

maggie haberman

And this idea came about of permanent government oversight at each federal agency of the executive branch, and each one would have their own watchdog in place. And they are supposed to do audits of operations. They’re investigating reports of waste or fraud or abuse. These oversight officers were essentially a bulwark against corruption, a bulwark against the type of abuses that took place during the Nixon era.

michael barbaro

So a kind of internal affairs department inside each agency of the executive branch?

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. Inside each agency of the executive branch was somebody who people could report tips to. And the I.G. could then investigate those and decide whether those were substantiated or not substantiated. And if they decide that there is something real there, they would immediately notify Congress within a week, within seven days. And so there is supposed to be this chain of accountability that exists with the I.G.s.

michael barbaro

And the final chain is Congress, so an entirely different branch of government.

maggie haberman

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And how are these inspectors general regarded after this law is passed?

maggie haberman

They are very respected. What was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch. And over the years, they have launched investigations into —

archived recording Strippers, casinos, Las Vegas — it sounds like a wild bachelor party, but instead, it’s Pentagon employees using their government-issued credit cards.

maggie haberman

Wasteful spending into fraud.

archived recording A new report by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security finds the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, or CIS, improperly granted citizenship —

maggie haberman

Into conflicts of interest, into abuse.

archived recording The Justice Department released details of a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report detailing chilling interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.

maggie haberman

And for the most part, presidents choose not to tangle with them. There are some notable exceptions. Ronald Reagan, for instance, replaced all of the inspectors general on day one. He said that he wanted a clean slate.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

George W. Bush raised some eyebrows with how he handled a NASA inspector general, for instance. And then we get to 2009. President Obama had been in office for only a handful of months. And at that point, he abruptly fires the inspector general, Gerald Walpin.

archived recording Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin. He is the inspector general of the Corporation and National Community Service. That is the federal agency responsible for distributing money to organizations like Americorps —

maggie haberman

Who was overseeing investigations into Americorps and other national service programs and how money was being spent on them.

archived recording He was investigating a close political pal of President Obama’s, but —

maggie haberman

And one of the people who Walpin was investigating was the Sacramento mayor and a former N.B.A. basketball star, Kevin Johnson. He was an Obama supporter, and the fact that there was a connection between the president and this person, who is connected to one of the groups that Walpin was looking at, raised a lot of eyebrows.

archived recording (gerald walpin) Well, actually, I was fired, because I was doing my job and doing it well and supporting my staff, who are —

maggie haberman

And President Obama alerted Congress that he had lost confidence in Walpin and was going to remove him from that position.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

[music]

And did he say why he lost confidence?

maggie haberman

He did not get into why he had lost confidence. He didn’t really offer any full explanation.

archived recording (chuck grassley) What we have here is a bigger problem with inspector generals that we got to watch this administration on.

maggie haberman

And at the time, Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, who has been very, very assiduous in his support for the I.G.s, was disturbed by what took place.

archived recording (chuck grassley) And I use inspector generals tremendously in my oversight work, so I’m going to fight hard to make sure they maintain their independence.

maggie haberman

He said at the time that he thought it looked as if Walpin had been doing a good job, that he had identified a lot of money in America funds that had not been used properly.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

The criticism of this move by Obama, it should be remembered, was not just Republicans. Claire McCaskill, senator from Missouri, who was an Obama supporter, was very critical of Walpin’s firing at the time. And this was the last time that Obama did this.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so lesson learned. Don’t mess with inspector generals.

maggie haberman

Right, or lesson certainly appeared to have been learned. It was, it was a hot stove that he touched, and he never touched it again.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

But from there, we got to President Trump, who, throughout his term, has been extremely skeptical of inspectors general.

michael barbaro

Why?

maggie haberman

He’s a business guy, Michael. He has never been in government before. And the idea of having this in-house adversarial relationship, somebody who works for him but who is there to tell him that he’s doing things wrong, is just a concept that’s anathema to him. And so he has chafed at it and has found it uncomfortable, to put it mildly. And then when they had started to do things that upset him, he becomes very angry. And that is what has led us to this unprecedented moment of, in the last two months, the president waging open war on the inspectors general.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Maggie, tell us about this unprecedented war that President Trump is waging on these inspectors general.

maggie haberman

So there have been four inspectors general who he has targeted. And in each case, he has felt some level of threat from each of them it seems. Michael Atkinson was the first one, and what’s important about Atkinson is he is the person who received a whistleblower complaint from an official in the intelligence community, who was detailed to the White House. And this complaint accused the president of an abuse of power related to foreign policy to force Ukraine’s government into announcing investigations related to Joe Biden and his son, that could have personal political benefit for the president. Atkinson found that complaint to be credible enough to have raised a, quote unquote, “urgent concern.” And it, under that label, had to be disclosed to Congress. And this report from Atkinson is what triggered the impeachment inquiry into the president. The president, last fall — before there were actual hearings related to the impeachment, but while Congress was starting to look at this — the president talked to his advisors about firing Michael Atkinson at the time. The president’s advisers told him this was a really bad idea. That if he did this, he was just throwing gasoline on an existing fire. So he waited, and the president was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial on February 5. And he dismissed Atkinson a handful of weeks later.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what does the president say when he fires Atkinson? Does he acknowledge that it appears to be an act of retribution for Atkinson’s role in the impeachment?

maggie haberman

No, the president does not acknowledge that at all.

archived recording (donald trump) I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.

maggie haberman

He says that he has lost confidence in Atkinson, and he says this in a letter to Congress.

archived recording (donald trump) He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.

maggie haberman

That was as much of a reason as Congress was getting.

archived recording (donald trump) That man is a disgrace to I.G.s. All right, let’s go.

michael barbaro

And I guess as much of a reason as the president needed to give Congress.

maggie haberman

All that he needed to say, and the way that he described it in his letter to Congress was, “As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general.” That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general. That’s as much as they got.

michael barbaro

And Maggie, what is the reaction in Congress, and I guess beyond Congress, to this firing of this inspector general?

maggie haberman

There was a large outcry.

archived recording (adam schiff) — course, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and what is this president doing as thousands of people are dying? He is retaliating against people that are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night. archived recording Listen, he got fired for political reasons. He got fired because the president believes that a deep state exists, a group of civil servants that are out to get him. That is not true.

maggie haberman

Democrats and even some Republicans said they were enormously troubled by what appeared to be an act of political retribution. But there was no consequence for this president. He’s right. It’s within his power of appointment as president. So he did it again a couple weeks later with another I.G.

michael barbaro

And who the second inspector general who was targeted by the president?

maggie haberman

Next up was Glenn Fine, who had been the acting inspector general for the Department of Defense since prior to President Trump took office. Now Michael, what was notable about Fine was that was about to become the chairman of a new committee that was going to do oversight on the spending in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This was going to be oversight of $2.2 trillion in coronavirus relief.

michael barbaro

So he was going to make sure that money was being properly spent. He was going to account for it.

maggie haberman

That’s right. Fine was going to be the watchdog for this massive amount of government spending. The president abruptly moved him out of his office, and therefore he couldn’t be the chairman of that committee. It seemed as if the president wanted to move out somebody who didn’t report directly to him or who was not promoted by him and not handpicked by him in the first place. That he wanted somebody who more fit that bill to sit on that committee that would be overseeing the spending of this $2.2 trillion.

[music]

Next on the list was the principal deputy inspector for the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm. She had done a report that was based on a number of interviews with hospitals all over the country, and those pinpointed massive shortages of supplies at various medical centers, efforts and struggles to obtain test kits, gear for hospital workers, ventilators that we’ve heard so much about since.

archived recording Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today, a survey, of more than 300 —

maggie haberman

The president was really unhappy about this report. What he said to reporters at the time was, it’s just wrong.

archived recording (reporter) I mean a week or longer. archived recording (donald trump) It’s just wrong. Did I hear the word “inspector general“? Really? It’s wrong, and they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.

maggie haberman

Many asked about who had written the report.

archived recording (donald trump) Well, where did it come from? The inspector general. What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) It came from the inspector general report — archived recording (donald trump) No, what’s his name? What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) I don’t know his name off the top of my head. archived recording (donald trump) Well, find me his name. Let me know, OK? If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it. archived recording But sir —

michael barbaro

He’s asking reporters for the name of the inspector general who has done something that has upset him.

maggie haberman

He was asking reporters to figure out for him — and he was assuming it was a male, it was a woman — who had written this report. Three weeks after Christi Grimm wrote this report, President Trump announced her replacement.

michael barbaro

OK, so that brings us, I believe, to inspector general number four. What is the story there?

maggie haberman

Inspector general number four, Steve Linick, had, according to Democratic congressional aides, opened up an inquiry into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife. And whether they were misusing a political appointee at the State Department to serve them, essentially — to perform menial duties like walking their dog, making restaurant reservations, picking up dry cleaning. And at the same time, Linick had been looking into, and was close to finishing, an investigation into Pompeo’s decision to go around Congress with an emergency declaration to approve billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year. There was an enormous outcry in Congress that this did not go through approval by congressional officials at the time. And Linick was looking into this.

michael barbaro

So the issue here is whether or not the State Department kind of created a false sense of urgency around approving an arms sale to the Saudi Arabian government.

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. And that report, as I said, was close to completion. So these two investigations were going on, and we are told that Mike Pompeo told the president that he thought that Linick should be fired. So on Friday, that’s exactly what happened. Another late Friday night ousting of an inspector general, Linick was announced as departed.

michael barbaro

What has been the reaction to this firing?

maggie haberman

Democrats are very upset about this.

archived recording (robert menendez) We need to know why an inspector general all of a sudden gets sacked on a Friday night, added to the three other I.G.s that have been sacked. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The fact is if it looks like it’s in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing, that could be unlawful.

maggie haberman

But given what’s happening with coronavirus, given that the attention of the country is largely on either the deaths caused by the virus or the economic devastation caused by the response to dealing with the virus, this has not broken through in the way that it might in any other moment in time.

michael barbaro

Hmm, how are Republicans reacting to this ouster?

maggie haberman

With the exception of some concern from Chuck Grassley, who’s been consistent about inspectors general, and Mitt Romney, who was very critical and who was the only Republican vote in favor of impeachment against President Trump, there has been radio silence from Republicans on this.

michael barbaro

It feels like the events of the past few months reveal a pretty central flaw in the original creation of the inspectors general, which is that it allows the president to fire these independent figures, right? I mean it’s interesting that it was created in the aftermath of Watergate as a check against bad actions in government. And yet, Watergate was all about a president being abusive, and here you have a law that allows a president to fire those internal watchdogs.

maggie haberman

Michael, I think you’ve identified the exact problem with this law, which is that it’s only as good as the honor system around it. Because if it’s just another piece of the president’s power, if the president isn’t going to abide by what these inspectors general find and let them do their investigations, then it’s not worth very much.

michael barbaro

So the political consequences for the president are, at this point, uncertain for removing these inspector generals. But I’m curious what you think the consequences are for the inspector generals who remain throughout the executive branch. I mean will this affect how they do their job?

maggie haberman

Michael, I think that we’re never going to know for certain most likely, but I could see scenarios where inspectors general feel like they can’t open an investigation, because if they do, it’s just going to get shut down. Or they get pieces of information, and they want additional confirmation before they’ll pursue something. It could absolutely have a chilling effect on how these folks do their jobs.

[music]

michael barbaro

Have any of these fired or dismissed inspectors general spoken out since they lost their jobs?

maggie haberman

There was a really remarkable statement that Michael Atkinson, the dismissed intelligence community inspector general, put out. And he defined this as a message he was leaving for, quote, “any government employee or contractor who believes they have learned of or observed unethical, wasteful or illegal behavior in the federal government.” And he had a very dramatic line in it, talking about the significance of his office: “The American people deserve an honest and effective government. They are counting on you to use authorized channels to bravely speak up. There is no disgrace in doing so.” And then he goes on to talk about the importance of whistleblower programs and says, “Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.”

[music]

michael barbaro

Maggie, thank you very much.

maggie haberman

Michael, thank you.

michael barbaro

On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in an interview that he had asked President Trump to fire the inspector general of the State Department, but said that it was not an act of retaliation. Democrats remain skeptical. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent President Trump a letter demanding a detailed explanation for the firing. In the letter, Pelosi called it, quote, “part of a pattern of undermining the integrity of the inspectors general and therefore our government.” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (alex azar) We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control. There was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.

michael barbaro

In a speech at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pointedly criticized the group, saying it had mishandled the original outbreak of the virus in China by promoting misinformation from the government there.

archived recording (alex azar) The status quo is intolerable. W.H.O. must change, and it must become far more transparent and far more accountable.

At the meeting, leaders of the World Health Organization said that they would review their response to the pandemic, something that several member countries, including the U.S. have demanded. And —

archived recording (donald trump) Yeah, I’ve taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here.

During a news conference on Monday, President Trump said that he has been taking doses of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the virus, despite a lack of evidence that it works.

The Times reports that the president’s disclosure has alarmed doctors, who fear it may encourage Americans to use the drug.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: President Trump has fired the inspector general for the Department of State, whose investigation posed a threat to his administration. Maggie Haberman on the pattern that that reveals. It’s Tuesday, May 19. Maggie, where does the idea of an inspector general come from?

maggie haberman

So the idea of inspectors general, who are basically public watchdogs, emerged out of the Watergate era.

archived recording (richard nixon) I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.

maggie haberman

Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace after abusing his office.

archived recording (richard nixon) As president, I must put the interests of America first.

maggie haberman

Faith in government dipped substantially among the public.

archived recording (richard nixon) By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing, which is so desperately needed in America.

[music]

maggie haberman

And this idea came about of permanent government oversight at each federal agency of the executive branch, and each one would have their own watchdog in place. And they are supposed to do audits of operations. They’re investigating reports of waste or fraud or abuse. These oversight officers were essentially a bulwark against corruption, a bulwark against the type of abuses that took place during the Nixon era.

michael barbaro

So a kind of internal affairs department inside each agency of the executive branch?

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. Inside each agency of the executive branch was somebody who people could report tips to. And the I.G. could then investigate those and decide whether those were substantiated or not substantiated. And if they decide that there is something real there, they would immediately notify Congress within a week, within seven days. And so there is supposed to be this chain of accountability that exists with the I.G.s.

michael barbaro

And the final chain is Congress, so an entirely different branch of government.

maggie haberman

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And how are these inspectors general regarded after this law is passed?

maggie haberman

They are very respected. What was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch. And over the years, they have launched investigations into —

archived recording Strippers, casinos, Las Vegas — it sounds like a wild bachelor party, but instead, it’s Pentagon employees using their government-issued credit cards.

maggie haberman

Wasteful spending into fraud.

archived recording A new report by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security finds the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, or CIS, improperly granted citizenship —

maggie haberman

Into conflicts of interest, into abuse.

archived recording The Justice Department released details of a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report detailing chilling interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.

maggie haberman

And for the most part, presidents choose not to tangle with them. There are some notable exceptions. Ronald Reagan, for instance, replaced all of the inspectors general on day one. He said that he wanted a clean slate.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

George W. Bush raised some eyebrows with how he handled a NASA inspector general, for instance. And then we get to 2009. President Obama had been in office for only a handful of months. And at that point, he abruptly fires the inspector general, Gerald Walpin.

archived recording Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin. He is the inspector general of the Corporation and National Community Service. That is the federal agency responsible for distributing money to organizations like Americorps —

maggie haberman

Who was overseeing investigations into Americorps and other national service programs and how money was being spent on them.

archived recording He was investigating a close political pal of President Obama’s, but —

maggie haberman

And one of the people who Walpin was investigating was the Sacramento mayor and a former N.B.A. basketball star, Kevin Johnson. He was an Obama supporter, and the fact that there was a connection between the president and this person, who is connected to one of the groups that Walpin was looking at, raised a lot of eyebrows.

archived recording (gerald walpin) Well, actually, I was fired, because I was doing my job and doing it well and supporting my staff, who are —

maggie haberman

And President Obama alerted Congress that he had lost confidence in Walpin and was going to remove him from that position.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

[music]

And did he say why he lost confidence?

maggie haberman

He did not get into why he had lost confidence. He didn’t really offer any full explanation.

archived recording (chuck grassley) What we have here is a bigger problem with inspector generals that we got to watch this administration on.

maggie haberman

And at the time, Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, who has been very, very assiduous in his support for the I.G.s, was disturbed by what took place.

archived recording (chuck grassley) And I use inspector generals tremendously in my oversight work, so I’m going to fight hard to make sure they maintain their independence.

maggie haberman

He said at the time that he thought it looked as if Walpin had been doing a good job, that he had identified a lot of money in America funds that had not been used properly.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

The criticism of this move by Obama, it should be remembered, was not just Republicans. Claire McCaskill, senator from Missouri, who was an Obama supporter, was very critical of Walpin’s firing at the time. And this was the last time that Obama did this.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so lesson learned. Don’t mess with inspector generals.

maggie haberman

Right, or lesson certainly appeared to have been learned. It was, it was a hot stove that he touched, and he never touched it again.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

But from there, we got to President Trump, who, throughout his term, has been extremely skeptical of inspectors general.

michael barbaro

Why?

maggie haberman

He’s a business guy, Michael. He has never been in government before. And the idea of having this in-house adversarial relationship, somebody who works for him but who is there to tell him that he’s doing things wrong, is just a concept that’s anathema to him. And so he has chafed at it and has found it uncomfortable, to put it mildly. And then when they had started to do things that upset him, he becomes very angry. And that is what has led us to this unprecedented moment of, in the last two months, the president waging open war on the inspectors general.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Maggie, tell us about this unprecedented war that President Trump is waging on these inspectors general.

maggie haberman

So there have been four inspectors general who he has targeted. And in each case, he has felt some level of threat from each of them it seems. Michael Atkinson was the first one, and what’s important about Atkinson is he is the person who received a whistleblower complaint from an official in the intelligence community, who was detailed to the White House. And this complaint accused the president of an abuse of power related to foreign policy to force Ukraine’s government into announcing investigations related to Joe Biden and his son, that could have personal political benefit for the president. Atkinson found that complaint to be credible enough to have raised a, quote unquote, “urgent concern.” And it, under that label, had to be disclosed to Congress. And this report from Atkinson is what triggered the impeachment inquiry into the president. The president, last fall — before there were actual hearings related to the impeachment, but while Congress was starting to look at this — the president talked to his advisors about firing Michael Atkinson at the time. The president’s advisers told him this was a really bad idea. That if he did this, he was just throwing gasoline on an existing fire. So he waited, and the president was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial on February 5. And he dismissed Atkinson a handful of weeks later.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what does the president say when he fires Atkinson? Does he acknowledge that it appears to be an act of retribution for Atkinson’s role in the impeachment?

maggie haberman

No, the president does not acknowledge that at all.

archived recording (donald trump) I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.

maggie haberman

He says that he has lost confidence in Atkinson, and he says this in a letter to Congress.

archived recording (donald trump) He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.

maggie haberman

That was as much of a reason as Congress was getting.

archived recording (donald trump) That man is a disgrace to I.G.s. All right, let’s go.

michael barbaro

And I guess as much of a reason as the president needed to give Congress.

maggie haberman

All that he needed to say, and the way that he described it in his letter to Congress was, “As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general.” That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general. That’s as much as they got.

michael barbaro

And Maggie, what is the reaction in Congress, and I guess beyond Congress, to this firing of this inspector general?

maggie haberman

There was a large outcry.

archived recording (adam schiff) — course, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and what is this president doing as thousands of people are dying? He is retaliating against people that are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night. archived recording Listen, he got fired for political reasons. He got fired because the president believes that a deep state exists, a group of civil servants that are out to get him. That is not true.

archived recording (richard nixon) By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing, which is so desperately needed in America.

[music]

maggie haberman

And this idea came about of permanent government oversight at each federal agency of the executive branch, and each one would have their own watchdog in place. And they are supposed to do audits of operations. They’re investigating reports of waste or fraud or abuse. These oversight officers were essentially a bulwark against corruption, a bulwark against the type of abuses that took place during the Nixon era.

michael barbaro

So a kind of internal affairs department inside each agency of the executive branch?

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. Inside each agency of the executive branch was somebody who people could report tips to. And the I.G. could then investigate those and decide whether those were substantiated or not substantiated. And if they decide that there is something real there, they would immediately notify Congress within a week, within seven days. And so there is supposed to be this chain of accountability that exists with the I.G.s.

michael barbaro

And the final chain is Congress, so an entirely different branch of government.

maggie haberman

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And how are these inspectors general regarded after this law is passed?

maggie haberman

They are very respected. What was originally 12 inspectors general expanded and became dozens and dozens across the executive branch. And over the years, they have launched investigations into —

archived recording Strippers, casinos, Las Vegas — it sounds like a wild bachelor party, but instead, it’s Pentagon employees using their government-issued credit cards.

maggie haberman

Wasteful spending into fraud.

archived recording A new report by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security finds the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, or CIS, improperly granted citizenship —

maggie haberman

Into conflicts of interest, into abuse.

archived recording The Justice Department released details of a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report detailing chilling interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.

maggie haberman

And for the most part, presidents choose not to tangle with them. There are some notable exceptions. Ronald Reagan, for instance, replaced all of the inspectors general on day one. He said that he wanted a clean slate.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

George W. Bush raised some eyebrows with how he handled a NASA inspector general, for instance. And then we get to 2009. President Obama had been in office for only a handful of months. And at that point, he abruptly fires the inspector general, Gerald Walpin.

archived recording Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin. He is the inspector general of the Corporation and National Community Service. That is the federal agency responsible for distributing money to organizations like Americorps —

maggie haberman

Who was overseeing investigations into Americorps and other national service programs and how money was being spent on them.

archived recording He was investigating a close political pal of President Obama’s, but —

maggie haberman

And one of the people who Walpin was investigating was the Sacramento mayor and a former N.B.A. basketball star, Kevin Johnson. He was an Obama supporter, and the fact that there was a connection between the president and this person, who is connected to one of the groups that Walpin was looking at, raised a lot of eyebrows.

archived recording (gerald walpin) Well, actually, I was fired, because I was doing my job and doing it well and supporting my staff, who are —

maggie haberman

And President Obama alerted Congress that he had lost confidence in Walpin and was going to remove him from that position.

michael barbaro

Hmm.

[music]

And did he say why he lost confidence?

maggie haberman

He did not get into why he had lost confidence. He didn’t really offer any full explanation.

archived recording (chuck grassley) What we have here is a bigger problem with inspector generals that we got to watch this administration on.

maggie haberman

And at the time, Chuck Grassley, the Republican senator from Iowa, who has been very, very assiduous in his support for the I.G.s, was disturbed by what took place.

archived recording (chuck grassley) And I use inspector generals tremendously in my oversight work, so I’m going to fight hard to make sure they maintain their independence.

maggie haberman

He said at the time that he thought it looked as if Walpin had been doing a good job, that he had identified a lot of money in America funds that had not been used properly.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

The criticism of this move by Obama, it should be remembered, was not just Republicans. Claire McCaskill, senator from Missouri, who was an Obama supporter, was very critical of Walpin’s firing at the time. And this was the last time that Obama did this.

michael barbaro

Hmm, so lesson learned. Don’t mess with inspector generals.

maggie haberman

Right, or lesson certainly appeared to have been learned. It was, it was a hot stove that he touched, and he never touched it again.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

maggie haberman

But from there, we got to President Trump, who, throughout his term, has been extremely skeptical of inspectors general.

michael barbaro

Why?

maggie haberman

He’s a business guy, Michael. He has never been in government before. And the idea of having this in-house adversarial relationship, somebody who works for him but who is there to tell him that he’s doing things wrong, is just a concept that’s anathema to him. And so he has chafed at it and has found it uncomfortable, to put it mildly. And then when they had started to do things that upset him, he becomes very angry. And that is what has led us to this unprecedented moment of, in the last two months, the president waging open war on the inspectors general.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Maggie, tell us about this unprecedented war that President Trump is waging on these inspectors general.

maggie haberman

So there have been four inspectors general who he has targeted. And in each case, he has felt some level of threat from each of them it seems. Michael Atkinson was the first one, and what’s important about Atkinson is he is the person who received a whistleblower complaint from an official in the intelligence community, who was detailed to the White House. And this complaint accused the president of an abuse of power related to foreign policy to force Ukraine’s government into announcing investigations related to Joe Biden and his son, that could have personal political benefit for the president. Atkinson found that complaint to be credible enough to have raised a, quote unquote, “urgent concern.” And it, under that label, had to be disclosed to Congress. And this report from Atkinson is what triggered the impeachment inquiry into the president. The president, last fall — before there were actual hearings related to the impeachment, but while Congress was starting to look at this — the president talked to his advisors about firing Michael Atkinson at the time. The president’s advisers told him this was a really bad idea. That if he did this, he was just throwing gasoline on an existing fire. So he waited, and the president was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial on February 5. And he dismissed Atkinson a handful of weeks later.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what does the president say when he fires Atkinson? Does he acknowledge that it appears to be an act of retribution for Atkinson’s role in the impeachment?

maggie haberman

No, the president does not acknowledge that at all.

archived recording (donald trump) I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible.

maggie haberman

He says that he has lost confidence in Atkinson, and he says this in a letter to Congress.

archived recording (donald trump) He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.

maggie haberman

That was as much of a reason as Congress was getting.

archived recording (donald trump) That man is a disgrace to I.G.s. All right, let’s go.

michael barbaro

And I guess as much of a reason as the president needed to give Congress.

maggie haberman

All that he needed to say, and the way that he described it in his letter to Congress was, “As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general.” That is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general. That’s as much as they got.

michael barbaro

And Maggie, what is the reaction in Congress, and I guess beyond Congress, to this firing of this inspector general?

maggie haberman

There was a large outcry.

archived recording (adam schiff) — course, we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and what is this president doing as thousands of people are dying? He is retaliating against people that are on his enemies list and doing it in the dead of night. archived recording Listen, he got fired for political reasons. He got fired because the president believes that a deep state exists, a group of civil servants that are out to get him. That is not true.

maggie haberman

Democrats and even some Republicans said they were enormously troubled by what appeared to be an act of political retribution. But there was no consequence for this president. He’s right. It’s within his power of appointment as president. So he did it again a couple weeks later with another I.G.

michael barbaro

And who the second inspector general who was targeted by the president?

maggie haberman

Next up was Glenn Fine, who had been the acting inspector general for the Department of Defense since prior to President Trump took office. Now Michael, what was notable about Fine was that was about to become the chairman of a new committee that was going to do oversight on the spending in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This was going to be oversight of $2.2 trillion in coronavirus relief.

michael barbaro

So he was going to make sure that money was being properly spent. He was going to account for it.

maggie haberman

That’s right. Fine was going to be the watchdog for this massive amount of government spending. The president abruptly moved him out of his office, and therefore he couldn’t be the chairman of that committee. It seemed as if the president wanted to move out somebody who didn’t report directly to him or who was not promoted by him and not handpicked by him in the first place. That he wanted somebody who more fit that bill to sit on that committee that would be overseeing the spending of this $2.2 trillion.

[music]

Next on the list was the principal deputy inspector for the Department of Health and Human Services, Christi Grimm. She had done a report that was based on a number of interviews with hospitals all over the country, and those pinpointed massive shortages of supplies at various medical centers, efforts and struggles to obtain test kits, gear for hospital workers, ventilators that we’ve heard so much about since.

archived recording Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today, a survey, of more than 300 —

maggie haberman

The president was really unhappy about this report. What he said to reporters at the time was, it’s just wrong.

archived recording (reporter) I mean a week or longer. archived recording (donald trump) It’s just wrong. Did I hear the word “inspector general“? Really? It’s wrong, and they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong.

maggie haberman

Many asked about who had written the report.

archived recording (donald trump) Well, where did it come from? The inspector general. What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) It came from the inspector general report — archived recording (donald trump) No, what’s his name? What’s his name? archived recording (reporter) I don’t know his name off the top of my head. archived recording (donald trump) Well, find me his name. Let me know, OK? If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it. archived recording But sir —

michael barbaro

He’s asking reporters for the name of the inspector general who has done something that has upset him.

maggie haberman

He was asking reporters to figure out for him — and he was assuming it was a male, it was a woman — who had written this report. Three weeks after Christi Grimm wrote this report, President Trump announced her replacement.

michael barbaro

OK, so that brings us, I believe, to inspector general number four. What is the story there?

maggie haberman

Inspector general number four, Steve Linick, had, according to Democratic congressional aides, opened up an inquiry into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his wife. And whether they were misusing a political appointee at the State Department to serve them, essentially — to perform menial duties like walking their dog, making restaurant reservations, picking up dry cleaning. And at the same time, Linick had been looking into, and was close to finishing, an investigation into Pompeo’s decision to go around Congress with an emergency declaration to approve billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year. There was an enormous outcry in Congress that this did not go through approval by congressional officials at the time. And Linick was looking into this.

michael barbaro

So the issue here is whether or not the State Department kind of created a false sense of urgency around approving an arms sale to the Saudi Arabian government.

maggie haberman

That’s exactly right. And that report, as I said, was close to completion. So these two investigations were going on, and we are told that Mike Pompeo told the president that he thought that Linick should be fired. So on Friday, that’s exactly what happened. Another late Friday night ousting of an inspector general, Linick was announced as departed.

michael barbaro

What has been the reaction to this firing?

maggie haberman

Democrats are very upset about this.

archived recording (robert menendez) We need to know why an inspector general all of a sudden gets sacked on a Friday night, added to the three other I.G.s that have been sacked. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The fact is if it looks like it’s in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing, that could be unlawful.

maggie haberman

But given what’s happening with coronavirus, given that the attention of the country is largely on either the deaths caused by the virus or the economic devastation caused by the response to dealing with the virus, this has not broken through in the way that it might in any other moment in time.

michael barbaro

Hmm, how are Republicans reacting to this ouster?

maggie haberman

With the exception of some concern from Chuck Grassley, who’s been consistent about inspectors general, and Mitt Romney, who was very critical and who was the only Republican vote in favor of impeachment against President Trump, there has been radio silence from Republicans on this.

michael barbaro

It feels like the events of the past few months reveal a pretty central flaw in the original creation of the inspectors general, which is that it allows the president to fire these independent figures, right? I mean it’s interesting that it was created in the aftermath of Watergate as a check against bad actions in government. And yet, Watergate was all about a president being abusive, and here you have a law that allows a president to fire those internal watchdogs.

maggie haberman

Michael, I think you’ve identified the exact problem with this law, which is that it’s only as good as the honor system around it. Because if it’s just another piece of the president’s power, if the president isn’t going to abide by what these inspectors general find and let them do their investigations, then it’s not worth very much.

michael barbaro

So the political consequences for the president are, at this point, uncertain for removing these inspector generals. But I’m curious what you think the consequences are for the inspector generals who remain throughout the executive branch. I mean will this affect how they do their job?

maggie haberman

Michael, I think that we’re never going to know for certain most likely, but I could see scenarios where inspectors general feel like they can’t open an investigation, because if they do, it’s just going to get shut down. Or they get pieces of information, and they want additional confirmation before they’ll pursue something. It could absolutely have a chilling effect on how these folks do their jobs.

[music]

michael barbaro

Have any of these fired or dismissed inspectors general spoken out since they lost their jobs?

maggie haberman

There was a really remarkable statement that Michael Atkinson, the dismissed intelligence community inspector general, put out. And he defined this as a message he was leaving for, quote, “any government employee or contractor who believes they have learned of or observed unethical, wasteful or illegal behavior in the federal government.” And he had a very dramatic line in it, talking about the significance of his office: “The American people deserve an honest and effective government. They are counting on you to use authorized channels to bravely speak up. There is no disgrace in doing so.” And then he goes on to talk about the importance of whistleblower programs and says, “Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices.”

[music]

michael barbaro

Maggie, thank you very much.

maggie haberman

Michael, thank you.

michael barbaro

On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in an interview that he had asked President Trump to fire the inspector general of the State Department, but said that it was not an act of retaliation. Democrats remain skeptical. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent President Trump a letter demanding a detailed explanation for the firing. In the letter, Pelosi called it, quote, “part of a pattern of undermining the integrity of the inspectors general and therefore our government.” We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (alex azar) We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control. There was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.

michael barbaro

In a speech at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pointedly criticized the group, saying it had mishandled the original outbreak of the virus in China by promoting misinformation from the government there.

archived recording (alex azar) The status quo is intolerable. W.H.O. must change, and it must become far more transparent and far more accountable.

michael barbaro

At the meeting, leaders of the World Health Organization said that they would review their response to the pandemic, something that several member countries, including the U.S. have demanded. And —

archived recording (donald trump) Yeah, I’ve taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here.

michael barbaro

During a news conference on Monday, President Trump said that he has been taking doses of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the virus, despite a lack of evidence that it works.

archived recording Can you explain, sir, though, what is the evidence that it has a preventative effect? archived recording (donald trump) Here we go. You ready? Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it. The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA with, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it, and we’ve done a great —

michael barbaro

The Times reports that the president’s disclosure has alarmed doctors, who fear it may encourage Americans to use the drug. The Food and Drug Administration has previously issued a safety warning about the medicine, saying that it can cause serious heart problems and should not be used outside of hospitals or clinical trials.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: Saving the U.S. economy from the fallout of the pandemic may require a historic infusion of cash. Ben Castleman on the debate over that spending. Its Monday, May 18. Ben, we’re talking to you on Friday morning, and a bunch of big, ugly, economic numbers just came out this morning. So we wanted to sift through them with you.

ben castleman

Yeah. It’s been a pretty dark morning for the economy.

michael barbaro

Where do you think we should start?

ben castleman

Maybe the place to start is actually on Thursday.

archived recording We turn now to the economy. Nearly 3 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week.

ben castleman

When we learned that another 3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.

archived recording That’s more than 36 million people in two months.

ben castleman

We’re two months into this crisis, and yet we are still losing millions of jobs every week.

archived recording For eight straight weeks now, jobless claims have been in the millions with 3 million more people filing for unemployment last week.

michael barbaro

Right. Every week.

ben castleman

Every week.

archived recording This did not happen naturally. All of these companies didn’t just go out of business because demand disappeared. We turned our economy off. Right? Think about New York. Think about the state of California. If you ran a restaurant, a mini golf course, or a clothing store, there’s a really good chance you would have laid your workers off.

ben castleman

And then, Friday morning, we get up.

archived recording It’s the services industries that are getting crushed here.

ben castleman

And we learn that retail sales in April were down more than 16 percent. That’s by far the worst that we’ve ever seen.

archived recording But as far as these retail sales go, worse than expected month over month.

ben castleman

Over the last two months, restaurants lost half their business. Apparel and clothing stores have lost nearly 90 percent of their business.

archived recording The country’s shut down, and people aren’t buying stuff. I hate to state the obvious, but they’re not buying cars, down 12 percent. They’re not buying furnishings and home furnishing items, down 58 percent. Clothing and clothing accessories, down 78 percent.

ben castleman

And then we got another data point that said that industrial production, right, this is the actual stuff that we make in the economy, was down by the most in more than a century that we’ve been keeping records, meaning worse than the Great Depression.

michael barbaro

In other words, as bad as it gets.

ben castleman

As bad as it has ever gotten. We know that this is deep. We know that it is broad-based. We don’t yet know how long it will last. And that’s the fundamental question going forward.

michael barbaro

So given all that, I want to turn to a speech.

archived recording Good morning. It’s my pleasure and privilege to welcome back Chair Jay Powell.

michael barbaro

That the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, made a couple of days ago, that I think speaks to all this data.

ben castleman

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve doesn’t make a ton of speeches, so I know that his words carry a lot of weight.

ben castleman

Yeah. So Jerome Powell comes out.

archived recording (jerome powell) The coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake.

ben castleman

Of course, he’s giving the speech remotely, so he’s in front of these blue curtains — or maybe they’re digitally superimposed blue curtains, I’m not actually sure — on a Zoom-style call. But he comes out with this really stark message.

archived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent.

ben castleman

And he’s saying, this economic crisis is incredibly deep.

archived recording (jerome powell) We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment.

ben castleman

It’s incredibly broad.

archived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased.

ben castleman

And it is hitting the most vulnerable workers more than anyone. He has this line early in the speech where he says —

archived recording (jerome powell) While we’re all affected.

ben castleman

“While we are all affected” —

archived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.

ben castleman

— “The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.”

archived recording (jerome powell) Among people who were working in February, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year, had lost a job in March.

ben castleman

Lower income Americans, black Americans, less educated Americans.

archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.

michael barbaro

And Ben Powell talks about this specter of permanent economic damage in this speech, and perhaps he was referring most urgently to these lower income workers. But I want to understand that concept, because it feels a little bit new to me. I think of almost all economic conditions as temporary. So what did he mean by that?

ben castleman

You’re right to think about most economic conditions as temporary, because historically, that is the way economists have thought about recessions and economic downturns — is some people lose their jobs, and then they get those jobs back when things get better. Some businesses lose business, or maybe they go out of business, but other things come back up and replace them. But we’ve learned over time that that is not the way recessions always work, and especially long and deep recessions. That when people lose their jobs, if they’re out of work for too long, they can drift away from the labor market. They can lose their connections, and all of a sudden, even when the economy starts to get better, it’s very hard for them to get back to work.

michael barbaro

I wonder if you can give me an example of this to bring it to life.

ben castleman

Well, imagine a small company, right, that maybe somebody has spent their lives, maybe a couple generations building. You could imagine if this crisis were to last a few weeks, they lose some revenue, they take a hit, but they start right back up where they left off. But as this drags on and they fall behind on loans, you fall behind on your rent payments, and all of a sudden, you can get to a place where you can’t reopen that business, where you can’t restart. And sure, the business owner might be able to go and find another job, but that business is lost forever.

michael barbaro

And so that is what Powell is referring to when he talks about permanent economic damage from this pandemic.

ben castleman

That’s what Powell fears, and that’s what he wants to make sure we avoid.

michael barbaro

What kind of solution, what kind of plan does he have in mind in this speech to avoid permanent economic damage?

ben castleman

Well, Powell starts by talking about all the things that we have already done, and he’s full of praise for that.

archived recording (jerome powell) The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful.

ben castleman

He talks about what the Fed itself has done, of course, but he also talks about —

archived recording (jerome powell) To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion.

ben castleman

— what Congress has done, the nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending that Congress has approved.

archived recording (jerome powell) For households, businesses, health care providers and state and local governments.

ben castleman

And there are a lot of programs that Congress has enacted to try to deal with this, right? They’ve written checks to virtually every American. They’ve offered loans and grants to businesses, and Powell says that all of those things have been incredibly important to softening the blow of this crisis.

archived recording (jerome powell) The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability and will provide some support to the recovery, when it comes.

ben castleman

But then, he says —

archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well.

ben castleman

— basically, we’re not done yet.

michael barbaro

That that was not enough.

ben castleman

That it probably won’t be enough. That we know now that this is not a crisis that is going to last for just a month or just a couple of months. It’s going to drag on. And that as it drags on, if the government doesn’t step in and do enough to keep people and businesses afloat, then we’re going to see a lot more of that kind of permanent damage that Powell is talking about.

michael barbaro

And when he suggests that we aren’t done yet, what is he really saying?

ben castleman

What he’s really saying is to Congress, you need to keep spending. The Fed will do what it can do, but the Fed can only lend money. It’s Congress that has the ability to spend money, to give money to people, to give money to businesses. And that is, in all likelihood, what it will take to get through this period. He describes what’s been done so far as a bridge, a bridge across temporary interruptions, he says. And what he’s basically saying is the bridge doesn’t yet reach all the way across the river. And a bridge doesn’t do you much good if it stops when you’re still over water.

michael barbaro

No. It does not. Is that normal for the chairman of the Fed to do this, to be advising Congress to spend a lot more money in this manner?

ben castleman

Not in as direct terms as this. But this was, at least by the standards of Fed chairs, a pretty direct call to action.

archived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it, if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This trade-off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers of taxation and spending.

michael barbaro

And can we safely assume that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve tells Congress, this is what I think you should do, that he assumes that that is what Congress will do?

ben castleman

Oh, I don’t think we should assume that Powell thinks that Congress will do it. But I think Powell knew that he was speaking at a moment when there’s a major political debate that’s playing out between Democrats and Republicans about what the role of government is in this crisis. And he’s, in effect, weighing in on one side of that debate, but I don’t think he’s under any illusion that he alone will resolve it.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro

So Ben, describe the divisions between Democrats and Republicans in Congress about this advice from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

ben castleman

Well, think back for a moment to those trillions of dollars in spending that have already taken place.

archived recording (charles grassley) I want to highlight a few areas of bipartisan economic relief we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their families.

ben castleman

When Congress approved those measures, it was really bipartisan.

michael barbaro

Right.

archived recording (chuck schumer) This is a strange and evil disease. There is much we still don’t know about it, and it is keeping us apart.

ben castleman

But that came at a moment when the economy was in the process of shutting down, and there was pretty widespread agreement that that had to happen.

archived recording (chuck schumer) When we passed this bill, instead of hugging each other, we’ll wave from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations through America’s darkest hours.

ben castleman

We’re now in a very different moment.

archived recording Democratic leader. archived recording (chuck schumer) Well, it’s been two weeks since Leader McConnell called us back into session.

ben castleman

Where there are real divisions between Republicans and Democrats about how quickly reopening should take place.

archived recording (chuck schumer) In that time, it was announced that 30 million Americans filed for unemployment. And yet the Republican leader has scheduled exactly zero votes, zero, on legislation related to the coronavirus crisis.

ben castleman

And with that comes real disagreement about the role of the federal government in continuing to support businesses and especially workers.

archived recording (chuck schumer) Let’s solve the problem right now. What are we going to do for people who are out of work?

ben castleman

The Democrats are by and large saying, much of the country is still shut down.

archived recording (chuck schumer) What are we going to do for businesses that are going under?

ben castleman

And so the government has to continue to support workers and businesses. It has to keep on spending. The Republican side is a little more complicated.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) This emergency is very serious. So the Senate’s response has been serious.

ben castleman

It’s not unanimous, but there is certainly, at least in Congress, more of an inclination to say —

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, here in the real world, Senate Republicans are working seriously to help the country reopen.

ben castleman

Let’s see how this reopening process goes. Let’s see if the businesses reopen, and if they do, maybe we don’t need to do very much more. And if they don’t come back and there’s a need for further action, then we can talk about that then.

michael barbaro

So it’s a bit more of a wait and see whether Congress really needs to spend all that much more money.

ben castleman

That’s right, and that question of spending is what’s hanging over this. The Republicans are looking at the trillions, with a T, that have been spent so far and saying, can we wait to spend more?

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) The crushing unemployment figures show us that no amount of federal spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more sustainable middle ground.

michael barbaro

Ben, how tied are these different approaches to the long-standing economic ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties?

ben castleman

Well, look, Republicans have a long-standing discomfort with programs like unemployment insurance.

archived recording (john coryn) At a certain point, these benefits are going to do more harm than good, and I would say they already are starting to do that. So extending unemployment benefits through next year would deter people from trying to return to work, because why would they? Why would someone choose to do more work for less money?

ben castleman

So it’s not surprising that as we move from the acute phase of this crisis into the long, slow recovery, that Republicans would be the first to start raising questions about the spending and to start thinking about pulling back on some of those programs.

archived recording (john coryn) So we’re already looking at staggering debt that we are going to have to deal with at some point, because it’s immoral to expect our kids and grandkids to pay that money back after we’ve already cashed those checks.

ben castleman

Democrats have long advocated for more generous unemployment benefits, for a larger role for government, and so it’s not too surprising that they are more comfortable with these programs lasting longer.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of this problem and understands that the approach to it is to get money down into the hands of the people who will put it down at the grassroots level and help support this economy from the ground up.

michael barbaro

And so this is the long-standing, very inflexible ideological terrain that Powell is entering when he goes to Congress and says, hey, cough up trillions of dollars more.

ben castleman

That’s right.

michael barbaro

But it feels like in this debate, the real anxiety is over just the enormity of the scale of money that we’re talking about. And I feel at this point, I have to ask you the question that we all pretend to know the answer to, which is: Where does all this money come from that Powell is suggesting Congress spend and that Democrats and Republicans are not really agreeing on whether to spend?

ben castleman

In the simplest terms, we’re borrowing it. The congressional budget office projects that the deficit this year will be $3.7 trillion.

michael barbaro

And we’re borrowing those trillions of dollars from whom?

ben castleman

So Congress decides how much it’s going to spend, and it of course sets tax rates as well. And any time that Congress decides to spend more than it brings in in tax rates, then the Treasury Department has to sell bonds to make up the difference. And that just means that it’s asking people, investors, foreign governments to lend the United States money. You give us money now, we’ll give you money back with a small amount of interest in anywhere from a few days to 10 years.

michael barbaro

Right. So when we hear about treasury bonds and their yields, that is the interest payment that the U.S. government is giving to someone who buys a treasury bond, and then the process has lent money to the U.S. and to Congress.

ben castleman

That’s right. Every time the government sells a bond, it’s borrowing money from the public. It’s paying some interest on that, just like if you borrowed money to buy a house or to make a purchase, to buy a car. The only difference is the federal government gets a much better interest rate than you or I ever will.

michael barbaro

So we kind of become the bank.

ben castleman

We become the bank.

michael barbaro

And to hear someone like Jerome Powell describe it, that doesn’t seem all that risky for Congress to spend all that money, which would require the U.S. borrowing that much from us and anyone who wants to buy U.S. treasury bonds. But is it risky?

ben castleman

So in the short term, there’s really no risk here. We can keep borrowing, as long as people will keep lending us money. In the long term, of course, we have to make good on those loans.

michael barbaro

Right.

ben castleman

And we have to pay interest on those loans. And so there will certainly be a debate when we come out the other side of this crisis about what the government should do about these huge deficits. But that debate is still years away. Because we’re at a very particular moment right now, which is that we’re in the middle of an immediate crisis. And if we don’t get our economy back on track, then none of that longer run debate matters. That debate is conditional on having an economy at all on the other side of this.

michael barbaro

Right. So you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all.

ben castleman

Yeah. Powell is saying, the debt is the least of our worries right now. It’s not that it doesn’t matter. It’s not that it will never matter. But we have to try to get the economy through this period and moving again, before we can worry about any of those other long-run concerns. You could think about it like performing CPR. Right? Performing CPR often involves breaking ribs, and that’s a real consequence. But that doesn’t mean you don’t perform CPR. You perform CPR, you try to get somebody whose heart started again, and then you worry about the other consequences once the person’s heart is beating again.

michael barbaro

And just to be clear, in this metaphor the broken ribs is massive U.S. debt spending on stimulus.

ben castleman

And the heart is the American economy, which right now is stopped and which we somehow have to get beating again. And so what you now have is Powell and lots of other economists who, like him, would normally be worried about the debt who are saying, now is not the moment. That includes people who were advisers to George W. Bush, people who were advisers to Republican candidates and Republican leaders throughout the last several decades. Pretty much all of the economists that I talk to and that my colleagues have been talking to are saying the same thing, which is now is not the moment to worry about the debt.

michael barbaro

So if this is the broad consensus of economists across the United States, Ben, why is this much of a debate in Congress at all?

ben castleman

Economists like to think that they issue these sage pieces of advice, and everybody on Capitol Hill and in statehouses will rush to follow them. But of course, that’s not the way the world works.

michael barbaro

And so it may well be the case that many members of Congress thank the Federal Reserve chairman but say, you know, we’re not going to follow that advice.

ben castleman

And we’ve already heard Republicans in Congress saying exactly that.

archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, we can’t spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again, consistent with the guidelines that have been laid down by the health care professionals toward opening up the economy. It’s the only solution to the dilemma with which we are confronted.

ben castleman

They just don’t believe that what Powell is saying right now is the real solution to our economic problems, even though many of their own economic advisers are telling them the same thing.

[music]

michael barbaro

Ben, thank you very much.

ben castleman

Thanks for having me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording [CHEERING] Congratulations. You did it. We’re so proud of you, Davie.

michael barbaro

Thousands of high school and college seniors across the country —

archived recording Yeah. Congratulations. Good job.

celebrated their graduation over the weekend in virtual ceremonies.

archived recording Happy graduation, Madison. We all love you! Love you!

michael barbaro

And were toasted in commencement speeches by everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Tom Hanks.

archived recording (tom hanks) You are the chosen ones. You are the chosen ones because of the fate unimagined when you began your Wright State adventures. You started in the olden times, in the world back before the great pandemic of 2020. You will talk of those earlier years in your lives just that way. Well, that was back before the Covid-19.

michael barbaro

In his commencement speeches, former President Barack Obama delivered pointed criticism of how the U.S. government has handled the pandemic.

archived recording (barack obama) More than anything, this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.

michael barbaro

Obama did not mention President Trump by name, but his remarks were seen as a clear indictment of his successor.

archived recording (barack obama) All those adults that used to think they were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out, they don’t have all the answers. A lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions. So if the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” When Louisiana’s stay at home order expires today, restaurants across the state can begin allowing customers back inside at their own discretion. That decision now lies with restaurant owners, like Jasmine Lombrage. It’s Friday, May 15.

jasmine lombrage

Hello?

michael barbaro

Hi.

jasmine lombrage

Hi, how are you?

michael barbaro

Oh, good. You sound great right now.

jasmine lombrage

Wonderful, wonderful. Hi. I’m Jasmine Lombrage.

michael barbaro

Hi, Jasmine. I’m Michael Barbaro.

jasmine lombrage

Hi, nice — nice to meet you this way.

michael barbaro

Very nice to meet you this way. Where exactly am I reaching you?

jasmine lombrage

I am at the Bullfish Bar Plus Kitchen here in Baton Rouge, La.

michael barbaro

That’s your restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

So how long have you lived in Baton Rouge?

jasmine lombrage

Me, personally, about 17 years. My husband has been here over 20 years. And we have two girls, two beautiful girls, Gaby — she’s turning 11 next month — and we have our gorgeous Angelle. She’s nine.

michael barbaro

How did you and your husband meet?

jasmine lombrage

[LAUGHS] It’s an old love story. We met at school. I was in dental hygiene school, and he was in culinary school. And he was working at that cafeteria. My friends said that they have good food over there, and they wanted to go. And so we went over there, and he was a quiet guy in the corner doing his own thing. I said, excuse me, what do you have here that is good and healthy that I can eat? And he looks up, and he said, Nothing is good enough for you.

michael barbaro

Oh, jeez.

jasmine lombrage

And then I turned to walk away, and he said, But if you come back tomorrow, I’ll make something for you.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

And I just kind of smiled and said, No, thank you. And I had a few friends who are like, Yes, we’re coming back tomorrow. So the next day, he made something for me. He made stir fry, and my friends — I had one of my crazy friends. She said — I said, I’m not going to eat. I don’t know if this guy is some kind of psycho or crazy and he’s going to put something in my food. She’s like, “Well, I’m going to eat. If nothing happens to me in a few minutes, then you — you can try it.” So that’s what happened. And he came back and asked, how was everything? I said, it was good. And then we started talking. Then — no then he said I’m going to be his wife, and I said, I’m sorry. That’s not going to happen. You know, and he said, well, he’s a praying man. He always gets his heart desire.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS]

jasmine lombrage

Yes, 10 years later, we ended up married.

michael barbaro

So when you — when you two met, you were a dental hygienist student. He was training to be a chef.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And so how did you end up in the food industry?

jasmine lombrage

Well, growing up, my mom always cooked, you know, for many people. So it was always a passion. I grew up cooking also with mom and just family and aunts. We just — that was just something we did. And then Angel, my husband, Chef Angel, my husband, you know, we — he was the executive corporate chef that started Voodoo BBQ & Grill, which is a restaurant here in the South. And he was known as the Pitmaster. And so what we did, we started Jazz City then, Jazz City was a catering company. And we were — he was like, well, this is what I love to do. And we wanted to do something — we have two young kids. We know that, you know, you can work hard for anyone and everyone, but really, if you want to leave that — create something for your family, you need to create something so that it can stay down and passed down for generations and generations and possibly grow. And that is our goal is to have it grow and flourish. And we ended up here at the Bullfish, and Bullfish was already — it was a restaurant previously owned by someone else. And when we came here, we made it our own by bringing new menu items. And this is the only place you can come in Louisiana and find an authentic Caribbean and Southern fusion cuisine. What he’s done, what Chef has mastered, he’s taken the fresh herbs that we have in the Caribbean, and then he’s merged it with the wonderful spices that we have here in Louisiana. And he — there’s a fusion of jerk, fish, and Southern barbecue shrimp.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. And the paella — you know, Chef makes a paella with — you know, he uses scallops. And the crawfish, which is from Louisiana, he infuses that with the andouille sausage, and then he puts the shrimp in there and the crab meat. And so it’s just the different twist that he puts on all of the dishes. It’s just magic in your mouth.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

And I don’t know if you heard the music in the background a little. We kind of use a lot of Caribbean kind of music from different parts of the Caribbean, and we play different music from here. The vibe is just so, I don’t need a passport, but I can get away here. Does that makes sense?

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. It’s funny you keep calling your husband “chef.” Is that how you refer to him?

jasmine lombrage

At work, we keep it professional. At home, well, when we get in a car, it’s “honey.” But when we’re at work, we refer to each other — I refer to him as Chef, and he would just say whatever he had to say to me or, OK, yes, ma’am, and that would be it.

michael barbaro

Got it.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And when did you take over the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

That was last year, 2019, May 22, 2019.

michael barbaro

OK. So just about — just about a year ago.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. And this restaurant, the Bullfish, it is personal for us, because our home is connected to the Bullfish.

michael barbaro

Huh.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. So that’s why this pandemic — I personally have spent many nights not sleeping, because I know our home is connected to it. It’s not like we have 5, 6, 7, 20 locations. This is all we have. In our home, we have two kids. My daughter, my oldest, Gaby, she’s autistic. I don’t know — I mean, I don’t know what’s going to happen, but for now, she’s depending on us to care for her. So as she grows, the home is — before we committed our home to the Bullfish — was part of the security blanket that we had. In the event something happened, she would have that.

michael barbaro

Tell me what you mean when you say that your home is connected to Bullfish. You mean physically or emotionally or what?

jasmine lombrage

Well, whenever you get a loan, you have to give some kind of guarantee, like a personal guarantee. And that’s what we did, you know. We took that leap of faith and decided that we were going to put 100 percent in here to make it work. So we have to make the Bullfish work.

michael barbaro

So if something were to happen to the restaurant, it would mean potentially losing your home?

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

And it sounds like that house is something you plan on passing on to your daughter, who’s autistic.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, well, both of our girls, but we know her, at least, we can have somewhere for her in case she needed somewhere to be, and then we can have that there for her. That is something that always gets me emotional talking about, because —

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

[CRYING] I’m sorry.

michael barbaro

I understand.

jasmine lombrage

It’s — you know, and she’s standing in front of me looking at me now. And we want to do whatever it takes to make it work. You know, we just have to make it work. So when this pandemic started, it really gave us a scare, because if we’re not able to pay for everything, and we default on our loan, well, we understood the consequences, you know.

michael barbaro

Was there a moment when you felt that you had really kind of made it with this place, having bought it and started to make it your own?

jasmine lombrage

Yes. About a month before the pandemic, we were like, yeah, this was a good choice. My husband and I, we usually go to early morning service for church, and afterwards, we came here for brunch. And then before we were open, we had people waiting outside for us.

michael barbaro

Wow.

jasmine lombrage

It was wonderful. And we were like, OK, wow, this is really going to work. This is really working. And wow, honey, this is our baby, and we’re going to grow it, and we’re going to be able to pay up the loan, and we’re going to be able to just blow this thing out of the park. And then the pandemic started. And yes.

michael barbaro

When did you first start to notice that the pandemic was impacting the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

OK, early March — early March, because it was February was good with Valentine’s Day. Early March is when everything started changing, and as March went on, the governor shut down the state. This is when, you know, you started losing staff members saying they’re not coming out. I mean, you cannot blame them. We also started doing curbside delivery, and we were doing social media posts and putting up signs, handwritten signs offering discounts, letting people know that curbside pickup is available, just getting different yard signs made.

michael barbaro

So you have to put up signs in the windows or outside telling people, we’re still around, you just need to call in.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, yes, yes. And then about maybe the second week after the state was closed, we would be lucky if we got two people that would call for curbside pickup. And we would just be sitting here the entire day, 11 to 8, and there’s no one that would come by or no one that would call. So then I started calling the restaurant phone a couple of times to make sure the phone was working, because it never rang. We were there for hours.

michael barbaro

So you called the restaurant’s main number with your cell phone just to see if it was working.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. [LAUGHS]

michael barbaro

Wow

jasmine lombrage

And, you know, I started reaching out to third party — third party delivery providers to see if I can sign up with them, like Uber Eats and Waitr and DoorDash and ChowNow. And they’re charging — some of them are charging from 25 percent to 35 percent.

michael barbaro

Per order?

jasmine lombrage

Yeah, that’s your food costs. Yes. You know, in addition to that, we’re not able to buy in bulk anymore, because we’ve wasted so much food. We’ve thrown away so much stuff, so now we’re having to go ourselves, Chef and I, to different mom and pop stores that are open, and we’re having to purchase items. Of course, now you’re paying more money for them, because you’re not buying the same quantity anymore, and you’re buying from a local retailer. So, you know, and then we have a bar here, and we weren’t — no one was coming out to drink anymore, so that went away. So yeah, the pandemic, you know, it’s been hard on us.

michael barbaro

Mm-hm. I’m so sorry.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

So with these delivery apps, these new sources of orders, how much money do you make off of any individual customer percentage-wise?

jasmine lombrage

Right now, you don’t, because the fact that we’re buying things from not just local distributors but smaller volume — we’re buying things in smaller volume, so our profit margin is smaller. So we’re basically not making anything. You’re keeping the doors open, but you’re not making anything from it.

michael barbaro

Can you give us a sense of where your daughters have been throughout this period? At what point was their schooling interrupted?

jasmine lombrage

Maybe March. Angelle, when did school close? March or April?

angelle lombrage

[FAINT] It closed in March.

jasmine lombrage

OK, school closed in March.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jasmine lombrage

I used to bring my — I still do bring my two girls, so I can homeschool them, because school — they are out of school. So I use a corner of the restaurant, and I do schooling there for my girls. But it was a challenge. The change was not welcomed and open for the girls, especially my oldest, Gaby.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

jasmine lombrage

You know, with autism, everything has to be — you need to have something — everything scheduled and everything has a plan you need to follow through. And this whole pandemic kind of just went haywire for her in the beginning. She was not sleeping. She was more agitated. And my youngest, Angelle, she kept saying she wanted to go back to school, so I had to find other ways to help them. So —

michael barbaro

And Jasmine, I think I hear your daughters in the background. Is that right?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, you do.

michael barbaro

Do you think there was a point where your daughters picked up on what has been happening for you and your husband, but beyond the stresses that they’re experiencing, you know, from not being at school and social distancing, that they understood that you and your husband are struggling with this business and struggling financially?

jasmine lombrage

I think so. There is one incident. My daughter, my youngest, she — you know, she gets allowance, and someone gives her money or whatever. And she saved the money, and one day, she wrote a note. And then she left a note on the bed, on my bed. I was taking a bath, and I came out, and she had a note saying that, Mom, I know you and Dad are working really hard, and things are really tough. I have some money saved. I hope this helps for you to pay for stuff.

michael barbaro

Oh, wow.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. That was hard. That was hard.

michael barbaro

How old is this daughter who left you —

jasmine lombrage

Angelle was 8 when she did that. She just turned 9 in April. So she had a pandemic birthday.

michael barbaro

Can I ask how much she gave you?

jasmine lombrage

I think it was like $57 she had.

michael barbaro

Wow. And what did you do with it?

jasmine lombrage

I still have it saved. I still have it there. I try not to use it. It was just such a touching moment, and just to see, you know, that they realize, kids realize more than you let them know. And knowing that they’re here like almost every single day with me, and —

michael barbaro

They see everything.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

How bad are things, financially speaking, right now?

jasmine lombrage

Not close at all to where we want to be. Not good at all. Not good at all. We have applied for a lot of, you know, small business loans, and we’re just waiting to hear back.

michael barbaro

Have you been able to cover all the payments that you owe to the bank?

jasmine lombrage

I haven’t. I think finance is one of the things people don’t like to talk about, but I haven’t been able to meet a lot of — I had to ask for abatements. So we’ll see what happens.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. I mean, do you think there is a situation that you could imagine using that money from your youngest daughter, that $57?

jasmine lombrage

I don’t want to — I don’t want to, because it’s hers. Even though she gave it to me, it’s hers. I do not want — I don’t want to.

michael barbaro

Right.

jasmine lombrage

I — I’m just afraid to — I’m just afraid to even think about a situation like that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Jasmine, for listeners who don’t know what the rules are in Louisiana, what was announced earlier this week?

jasmine lombrage

Well, restaurants — commencing Friday, you can, restaurants can be open for 25 percent of the capacity.

michael barbaro

So you can seat up to 25 percent of what would normally fit inside the restaurant. So how many people do you think that is?

jasmine lombrage

Well, we can seat about 90 people comfortably in here. And so about 25 percent of that now is what we’re allowed to do.

michael barbaro

So if you can only put, you know, 20 or so people inside, can you make money?

jasmine lombrage

I don’t see how that’s going to happen, to be honest with you, because 20 percent — having 20 percent of people inside the business is not enough to sustain, and I don’t know how long that’s going to go on for.

michael barbaro

Right.

jasmine lombrage

So [SIGHS] it’s hard. It’s a hard thing to digest right now.

michael barbaro

But you have decided that you’re going to let people back inside?

jasmine lombrage

Honestly, me, personally, no. So it is still an open debate. We — actually, after I’m done with this interview, we’re going to sit down and weigh our options, the pros and the cons, and see if it’s something that we want to do.

michael barbaro

Can I ask you what you see as the cons and the pros?

jasmine lombrage

Yeah, the pros — that, you know, we’ll have 25 percent more revenue than what we’re seeing now. And then the cons is knowing that someone will — I’m afraid that, oh, my god, somebody’s going to come out, and they’re a carrier of Covid-19, and they infect somebody else. So I have no way of controlling that.

michael barbaro

Have you heard from customers about their opinions on whether it’s time to go back inside the restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, I have. I’ve had mixed reviews. We tend to ask customers, whenever they’re picking up or, are they ready for everything to open back up. That’s normally the question we would ask. And I feel that I’m getting more nos than yes, though, in my opinion.

michael barbaro

Mm.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

Those who have told you, Jasmine, that they do want to come out, what did they say is their reason for wanting to come out, to come back and eat in a restaurant?

jasmine lombrage

They want to get out of the house. You know, sometimes it’s just the fact that you cannot do something makes you want to do it.

michael barbaro

[LAUGHS] Yes. Yes, the forbidden fruit. Yes.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. My point, that’s exactly. Like, oh, you tell me I cannot eat this? OK, I’m going to. So yes, that’s what I feel I’m getting.

michael barbaro

I wonder, for you, if you didn’t run a restaurant, would you go out and eat right now? Would you walk into a restaurant, sit down, order food?

jasmine lombrage

I would probably go out on a weekday, because weekdays are usually less busy, because I have a child that has a compromised immune system. So I’m usually very careful to go out. I don’t want to take something home to her, so that would be another reason that I personally will not go out. And if I did go out, minus my daughter’s situation, I would have definitely found the seat — ask to be seated in the area that is far away from everybody else.

I mean it’s interesting to hear you say that, that you wouldn’t want to go to a restaurant unless it was specifically at a slow time because of the health of your daughter, because you’re talking about yourself reopening a restaurant. So it’s quite a weird conundrum.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, but it’s honest.

michael barbaro

I just want to make sure I understand which of your daughters is immunocompromised.

jasmine lombrage

Gaby is.

michael barbaro

Is that the daughter who is autistic?

jasmine lombrage

Yes, because she was a former premature baby. I ruptured at 14 weeks when I was pregnant with her, and she had a lot of health challenges. They said, you know, that Gaby would never walk, talk, see, or hear. She was not via — she does not have any viability of life, and that she would never make it out of the hospital alive, you know. We were told that we were making a mistake for her. She coded, and it was even pronounced, and she came back. And she had a trach before, and she was on a ventilator before. She was on oxygen for the first — almost the first four years of her life. You know, she started talking late, walking late, and she had to do therapy, and, you know, she had a walker. So she had a lot of challenges to see where she is now and where she came from. So I’m always careful, you know. A typical cold for you and I is just a cold, but for her, it can lead to pneumonia, or we’ve lost her. We’ve had her stop breathing a couple times, and nothing — I don’t even know how to explain that.

michael barbaro

Mm. Given your daughter’s health, are you worried that you’re going to basically be in the kind of situation it sounds like you’re afraid of kind of all the time, because people are going to be coming into your restaurant, and they could potentially get you sick, and you could potentially get your daughter sick?

jasmine lombrage

Yes. You know, I don’t know what I would do if I find myself bringing something to my child. So I find myself in a very difficult position as a business owner.

michael barbaro

That would be very hard to live with. I understand.

jasmine lombrage

That would — yes. You know —

michael barbaro

I mean, it sounds — it sounds like that —

jasmine lombrage

[SIGHS]

michael barbaro

— that has to — that has to be weighing on you as you’re making this decision.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, it is. It is. It is. This is personal. This is not like, oh, OK, well, I’m just going to open and make the money. It’s not that situation for me. I have to be careful for it. I am responsible for her, and I’m also responsible for my customers, making sure they have the best experience. And I’m also responsible for my team that are coming to work. So —

michael barbaro

And you’re also responsible for that house —

jasmine lombrage

Yes!

michael barbaro

— that is connected to this —

jasmine lombrage

Right!

michael barbaro

— restaurant.

jasmine lombrage

Yes.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

jasmine lombrage

So my hands are tied. Like, yes. It — yes, I’m just — I’m just in a bind. Yeah, I’m just in a bind right now. And say hi, Gaby.

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Hi, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Say hi. It’s OK.

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Oh, I want to see you on the video. Nice to meet you, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Can you see her? I don’t know how this works.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. I can see her. Yeah, she’s got a great — she’s got a leopard patterned sweater on.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. Are you going to talk?

gaby lombrage

Hi.

michael barbaro

Hi. Gaby is waving.

gaby lombrage

How are you doing?

michael barbaro

I’m doing well. Your mom was just telling us about you. She — she loves you.

jasmine lombrage

Yes. [LAUGHS] Yes.

michael barbaro

She loves you — she loves you very much.

jasmine lombrage

I do. I love you, Gab.

gaby lombrage

I love you, too.

jasmine lombrage

OK.

michael barbaro

Well, that was — that was a nice gift.

jasmine lombrage

Yes, she walked up, so. [SIGH] I’m sorry.

michael barbaro

Yeah, just give me a sec. Oof.

jasmine lombrage

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that —

michael barbaro

No, I —

jasmine lombrage

Hence the reason why I’m torn up. For someone that was 1 pound, 3 ounces when she was born, she is like — she’s like — I mean she’s beautiful. She’s doing so well. And then this is so scary.

michael barbaro

Yeah.

jasmine lombrage

This is so scary, you know. And then it’s a hard decision. I — we don’t open up, then to get customers to come in, we’re putting our house more at risk. We open up, and then something happens, then I’m putting my child’s life at risk. I don’t want — I don’t even want to be me right now.

michael barbaro

Yep. I’m going to be really eager — we’re all going to be very eager to understand what decision you make. And I want you to know that we really enjoyed getting to know you and talking to you, and we’re rooting for you and for your family.

jasmine lombrage

Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you.

michael barbaro

Thank you, and please give our best to your husband and to the rest of your family.

jasmine lombrage

Thank you.

gaby lombrage

Bye.

jasmine lombrage

Gaby says bye.

michael barbaro

Bye, Gaby.

jasmine lombrage

Say bye.

gaby lombrage

Bye.

jasmine lombrage

OK, thank you, guys.

michael barbaro

Bye.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[music]

Today: Federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mark Mazzetti on what led to that decision. It’s Thursday, May 14. Mark, remind us where the Michael Flynn story starts.

mark mazzetti

Well, Michael Flynn was a three-star Army general who had a quite distinguished career, became the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under the Obama administration. And then he gradually sort of moves into the Trump orbit in 2016 when Trump was running for president. During the Republican convention —

archived recording (michael flynn) We do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law.

mark mazzetti

— he famously leads a chant —

archived recording (crowd) Lock her up! archived recording (michael flynn) Yes, that’s right, lock her up!

mark mazzetti

Of “lock her up,” meaning to Hillary Clinton.

michael barbaro

Right.

archived recording (michael flynn) If I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.

mark mazzetti

And after Trump is elected, he announces that he’s going to make Flynn his national security adviser. So it’s during this time when there’s a series of events that get Michael Flynn into trouble.

[music]

It’s shortly after Christmas in 2016 when the Obama administration announces a number of sanctions against Russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign. It was soon after that —

archived recording The Washington Post reports that Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, repeatedly called the Russian ambassador to the U.S. —

mark mazzetti

— that The Washington Post reported that Flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the Russian ambassador —

archived recording — on the exact same day —

mark mazzetti

— on the same day the Obama sanctions were announced, which raised questions about whether the incoming Trump administration was trying to meddle with the Obama administration’s foreign policy.

archived recording (mike pence) I talked to General Flynn about that conversation. Actually, it was —

mark mazzetti

Vice President-elect Mike Pence goes on “Face the Nation.”

archived recording (mike pence) They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to impose a censure against Russia.

mark mazzetti

Pence says that Flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call. But the Justice Department had transcripts of the calls in which Flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the Obama administration’s sanctions.

archived recording F.B.I. agents interviewed Michael Flynn about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian —

mark mazzetti

So F.B.I. agents are sent to the White House to interview Flynn.

archived recording What has he told investigators?

mark mazzetti

He tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s lying to the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

Right. This all becomes public, and in February 2017 —

archived recording General Michael Flynn suddenly resigned late last night.

mark mazzetti

— Flynn is forced to resign.

archived recording He is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what happens to Flynn once he’s pushed out of the White House?

mark mazzetti

The F.B.I. continues to investigate Flynn, but very little is heard from him for a number of months. And during this time, President Trump starts leaning on James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in essence, to drop the Flynn investigation.

michael barbaro

Right.

mark mazzetti

And that raised this idea that the President of the United States was trying to obstruct justice. And that’s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only Comey being fired, but also the appointment of Mueller as the special counsel.

michael barbaro

Right. In many ways, the Flynn saga is the beginning of the Mueller saga, and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the Trump administration.

mark mazzetti

That’s correct.

michael barbaro

What ends up happening to Michael Flynn?

mark mazzetti

Well —

archived recording Flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

Flynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I.

archived recording — says that he is cooperating —

mark mazzetti

Becomes a cooperating witness in the Mueller investigation. He’s awaiting sentence.

archived recording Court documents make clear that Flynn was not acting alone.

mark mazzetti

And the significance was that he was the first top White House official to plead guilty as part of the Mueller investigation.

archived recording Court papers say Flynn could get up to six months behind bars, but he was under —

michael barbaro

Mark, I feel like, for many people, that is where the Michael Flynn story pretty much ends, right? I mean, you have this three-star general, national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the F.B.I., and now he’s headed to prison.

mark mazzetti

That’s right. And the Mueller investigation marches on, and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when Flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge. And the Mueller team weighs in —

archived recording Breaking news right now. Bob Mueller’s office is recommending to the judge that Michael Flynn actually not receive any prison time.

mark mazzetti

— and says Flynn’s been a good witness.

archived recording Michael Flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel.

mark mazzetti

They recommend very little, if any, jail time.

archived recording The defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials.

mark mazzetti

And something curious happens then, where Flynn’s legal team, which had been very cooperative towards the Mueller investigation, clearly — they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the Mueller team — decide to take a more combative stance. They enter into the public record this idea that maybe Flynn had been railroaded, that the F.B.I. may have set him up. So this angers the judge. He really reads Flynn and his team the riot act, saying, are you now saying you’re not remorseful? And why are you now accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct? And basically says, let’s take a pause. We’re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you’ve found some remorse. In the intervening time, the ground starts to shift.

[music]

archived recording William Barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general, gaining broad control of the special counsel, Robert Mueller’s, Russia investigation.

mark mazzetti

William Barr takes over as attorney general.

archived recording (william barr) I believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation.

mark mazzetti

He, during his confirmation hearing, pledges that he’s not going to interfere with the Mueller investigation. So Mueller famously then delivers his report to Barr in March of 2019.

archived recording (william barr) The deputy attorney general and I concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.

mark mazzetti

And Barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes Mueller’s findings, which we now know misinterprets the Mueller report. It’s quite clear starting at that point that Barr has great issues with not only the Mueller investigation, but how this all began — how the Russia investigation began at the F.B.I. and whether there was real misconduct.

archived recording (william barr) I’ve been trying to get answers to questions, and I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate, and I also —

mark mazzetti

So he makes no secret of the fact that he’s going to start investigating the investigation. He is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after Donald J. Trump and his advisers.

michael barbaro

And what does that mean for Michael Flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the F.B.I.?

mark mazzetti

As the ground shifts, and as it’s clear that Barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation, Flynn decides to get a new lawyer.

archived recording (sidney powell) Nothing about this case was done right. They violated every rule, every protocol.

mark mazzetti

Who is not only a lawyer, but also a pundit of sorts.

archived recording (sidney powell) The entire prosecution was false. It must be dismissed.

mark mazzetti

This is a Texas lawyer named Sidney Powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt.

archived recording (sidney powell) Their prosecution of General Flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president, because they already knew the Russia hoax had fallen apart.

mark mazzetti

Very much in line with what the President of the United States has said.

archived recording (sidney powell) So the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the F.B.I.

mark mazzetti

And days before she takes over as Flynn’s lawyer, she writes a secret letter to Attorney General Barr where she writes, quote, “It is increasingly apparent that General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes.”

michael barbaro

Wow. So you’re saying Flynn recognizes the winds are changing, recognizing that there’s literally a new sheriff, attorney general in town, who’s skeptical of the entire Russia investigation, and so Flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic.

mark mazzetti

Yes. And during that period of time, Attorney General Barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who’s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place.

michael barbaro

So just to be clear, in addition to examining the roots of the Russia investigation broadly, Barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the Department of Justice just to examine the Flynn case?

mark mazzetti

That’s right.

[music]

And that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both Flynn’s lawyers and the president to make the case that Michael Flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the F.B.I.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Mark, tell us what’s inside these documents.

mark mazzetti

In essence, the documents are internal F.B.I. and Justice Department communications around the time that Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. And what they show, kind of broadly, are that there was concern about the decision to interview Flynn. One of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by Bill Priestap, who at the time was the head of the F.B.I.‘s Counterintelligence Division, which was running the whole Russia investigation. And this is January 24, four days after the Trump administration takes over, and right before there is this decision to go send F.B.I. agents to interview the national security adviser. And Priestap writes, quote, “What’s our goal, truth/admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”

michael barbaro

Wow.

mark mazzetti

In another document, he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview, and he says, “Protect our institution by not playing games. And if we are seen playing games, the White House will be furious.”

michael barbaro

Some of that language is quite potentially inflammatory, the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired — essentially, to get him in trouble.

mark mazzetti

It raises this question of whether Sidney Powell, Flynn’s lawyers, had a point, that they were trying to set him up, right? And finally, there’s also interesting divide that is revealed between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of Justice Department about what the F.B.I. was up to.

michael barbaro

So there’s some concern about whether or not interviewing Flynn is at all a good idea.

mark mazzetti

Right. And we find out that the F.B.I. only tells the Justice Department they’re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the White House.

michael barbaro

Huh. Mark, what happens once these internal F.B.I. documents are released? What’s the reaction?

mark mazzetti

This unleashes a torrent of criticism.

archived recording (sidney powell) He should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt.

mark mazzetti

By Flynn’s lawyer, Sidney Powell —

archived recording (sidney powell) — that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing Mr. Flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up.

mark mazzetti

— by other commentators on the right —

archived recording 1 A lot of people close to this feel like Michael Flynn was setup, never lied. archived recording 2 Admitting that they got things completely wrong, and actively worked to defame — archived recording 3 Instead, it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the F.B.I. handled Hillary Clinton and how they handled Donald Trump.

mark mazzetti

— by President Trump —

archived recording (donald trump) When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn.

mark mazzetti

— making the case that Flynn should never have been interviewed, and the case should now be dropped.

[music]

michael barbaro

And what would be the legal basis for that argument? What in the documents do Flynn’s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate?

mark mazzetti

Well, they’re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the F.B.I. about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

mark mazzetti

And if the interview doesn’t take place, then there’s no lies to worry about. And if there’s no lies, then there’s nothing to prosecute Flynn on. And therefore, there is no case period, and Michael Flynn should walk free. You have no predicate to be there in the beginning, then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation. And this is what Barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week.

archived recording Just in this afternoon, the Justice Department is dropping its criminal case against President Trump’s former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn.

mark mazzetti

To drop the charges against Michael Flynn.

archived recording The Justice Department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of Flynn.

mark mazzetti

Barr said there was never any good reason to interview Michael Flynn in the first place, and so whatever Flynn said during the interview was irrelevant. And Barr even goes further than that.

archived recording (catherine herridge) Attorney General Barr, thank you for speaking first to CBS news. archived recording (william barr) Hi, Catherine.

mark mazzetti

In an interview last week, he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview Flynn —

archived recording (william barr) There was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation —

mark mazzetti

— but he also goes to bat for Flynn going all the way back to Flynn’s phone calls with the Russian ambassador.

archived recording (william barr) And it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders. And that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. In fact, it was laudable. And it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administration’s policies, and it was in U.S. interest. He was saying to the Russians, don’t escalate.

mark mazzetti

He actually says that the phone calls were laudable, and that it was perfectly understandable that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment.

archived recording When history looks back on this decision, how do you think it will be written? archived recording (william barr) Well, history is written by the winners, so it largely depends on who’s writing the history.

michael barbaro

I mean, what’s fascinating about what Barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the Department of Justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant.

mark mazzetti

And it’s in keeping with what William Barr has done for a year. From the time that Robert Mueller presented his report to barr, Barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation. He has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly, or whether the F.B.I. overreached. He has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others.

michael barbaro

Mark, is Barr’s legal analysis in the Flynn case sound? Is it in dispute?

mark mazzetti

Barr’s decision has been widely criticized. Plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue, what is germane to the case, and in this specific instance, the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between Trump aides and the Russians would make Flynn’s calls germane to this particular investigation. That is not to say that now looking back, there haven’t been instances of F.B.I. abuse over the course of the Russia investigation.

michael barbaro

Mark, given everything you’ve just said, and reading these documents that have been released from the Department of Justice about the debate that went on inside the F.B.I. — these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview, whether they might, basically, trap Flynn in a lie and get him fired — I mean, is there a version of this where what Bill Barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution, which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant?

mark mazzetti

You always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted. That’s true if the target is Michael Flynn, or if the target is someone far less famous. The concern, of course, is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

mark mazzetti

That what the attorney general is doing is, in effect, launching a campaign to discredit the investigation, to discredit the Mueller probe, to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss, President Trump. Remember, President Trump, who’s been railing against the quote unquote “witch hunt” for years, will be using this for his re-election campaign. So the concern, of course, is that Bill Barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president.

michael barbaro

But Mark, is it possible that both things can be true — that the Attorney General Bill Barr may be trying to discredit the entire Russia investigation, and in the process, very much oversimplify things, and that the prosecution of Michael Flynn might be flawed?

mark mazzetti

Yes, both of those things can be true.

[music]

And this is why the passions are so intense on this issue, because both sides want to control the narrative, and because of that, can’t allow, necessarily, any gray area in this argument. Either Michael Flynn is a hero or he’s a traitor. Either the Mueller investigation was a just pursuit, or it was a witch hunt. And of course, there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white.

michael barbaro

So Mark, what’s going to happen to Michael Flynn now?

mark mazzetti

Well, of course, given what William Barr decided, there is a very likely scenario that Michael Flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold, and in the coming months, we see him once again campaigning for Donald Trump.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Mark.

mark mazzetti

Thanks, Michael.

[music]

michael barbaro

On Wednesday night, The Times reported that before the Department of Justice sought to throw out the case against Michael Flynn, it had interviewed the F.B.I. official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap Flynn. In that interview, the official, Bill Priestap, said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set Flynn up.

[music]

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity —

michael barbaro

In a speech on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the American economy if Congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment.

archived recording (jerome powell) Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt.

michael barbaro

The message from Jerome Powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that Congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough.

archived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.

michael barbaro

And the House of Representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely, so that they can avoid traveling to Washington during the pandemic. The rules, expected to pass tomorrow, would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person.
